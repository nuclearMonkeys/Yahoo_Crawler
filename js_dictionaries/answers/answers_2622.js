	136924 : ["I wanted Mickie James to win this 25 diva battle royal because she's been in wrestlemanias and main evented for the divas at wrestlemania 22 against Trish Stratus where i say she carried the whole match. Mickie James has been in WWE for longer than most of the divas in WWE today. That's not the only fact she's one of the greatest women's wrestler WWE has and she's always exciting and entertaining in the ring. She carried the whole battle royal in her battle against Michelle McCool. Mickie James also worked extremely hard to get in the WWE and she is a fantastic wrestler great on the mic and gets huge pops from the fans. Yes Gail Kim should have been one of the top candidates to win it but Mickie James should be just as recognized for her talent and she symbolizes women wrestling in WWE today. Gail Kim at that time only just returned so i think it would have been more respectful if Mickie a long time diva in WWE won the battle royal. I was disgusted with Santina winning just as much as you and she had no right to win that battle royal. So many other great divas were there Victoria Mickie James Beth Phoenix Gail Kim and so many others deserved the opportunity to be called Miss Wrestlemania. What makes it worse is that divas from the past were there as well and they came to participate in the grandest stage of them all only to lose to a cross dressing man. That is huge disrespect on WWE's part and instead of having a true diva win it it's instead given to a man. What makes me more disgusted is that Santina is the focus of Raw's diva division it's all about Santina and Vickie Guerrero. WWE treats their divas wrong and it just disgusts me. Every time this topic comes up i could write tons of paragraphs on what WWE does wrong with their talented women wrestlers. BQ: I don't know unless you like looking at the title from time to time or you like to just play around with your friends by having a championship around and wrestling around for it. If you're not going to do anything with it what's the point of wasting money and buying it? Buy it if it's going to significant and special to you but if you don't do anything with it i honestly don't see the point.", 11334, "4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa", 7],
	136925 : ["Santina was a terrible idea and the Raw divas have been stuck taking the sidelines to this. I really hope the storyline ends at Extreme Rules. I never liked a current diva winning it. Mickie was a popular choice, but I disagreed. If a current diva won, they'd get put too far over the others, knowing she'd have the title of Miss Wrestlemania, the event of the last 25 years. Remember that this was before the title was a total joke.  I wanted Trish Stratus to win. Of course, she never competed. Trish was probably the diva most familiar to Wrestlemania that still would have been able to compete. She had been the representative of the divas in the current century, and probably the most deserving of the crown, even if her wrestling skill was very much average. Lita would have been my second choice for the same reasons, but she never competed either. Of the ones that competed, I would have gone with Victoria, but she had no chance... she'd been okay with putting the other divas over.

	136928 : ["Honest to goodness, it really sounds like your an Androgyne.  Androgynes do not have GID and do not require any surgery.  Our biggest challenge is to simply accept who we are.  Once we are able to do that, our lives open up to many wonderful possibilities.  Here is a brief definition of the term Androgyne that helped me tremendously. ANDROGYNE  Definition:  A biological condition resulting from hormonal miscues during fetal washing of the brain during gender  identity development. The patient postnatally merges both polar gender identities displaying an assortment  of both masculine and feminine emotional, mental, and physical qualities.  Alternative names: third gender; bi-gendered What is a person who is Androgyne? A person who psychologically, intrinsically and socially intermediates between male and female, displaying physical traits and manifesting a merging of the roles traditionally stereotyped as belonging to male and female. The primary difference between people who are Androgyne and other individuals is that they cannot live life fully as either men or women because they are intrinsically both genders.  Is there a biological basis for Androgynes?  Yes. The biological basis for the inborn condition stems from an interaction between the developing brain and sex hormones in the first trimester. There is the formation of a gender system within the brain that is fundamental to ultimate gender identity and gender-role development. The person's development and individual choice accelerates or retards the emergence or degree of characteristics, behaviors or self-expression of their biological capability. People manifest their condition at different stages in their lives ranging from infancy to old age. The genetic and endocrine systems provide a \"fertile soil\" for environmental influences; thus, biology creates the capacity while nurture and individual choice accelerate the emergence or degree of the condition.  What are the causes? Biologically, it is the result of the process by which embryos take on sex differences. Androgynes are the result of abnormalities in the male and female sex chromosomes and imbalances in hormone washing of the fetal brain. All human embryos develop in the very earliest stages of gestation along more or less feminine lines. Those destined to become males differentiate from the master template after a complex series of hormonal secretions starts to masculinize the embryo. This produces what is called the brain's hardwiring, or subconscious mind. Miscues in this process result in crossed signals in the portions of the brain that are responsible for gender identity. Therefore, the brain develops with the subconscious mind of one biological sex and the body develops with the alternating biological sex. Years later the conflict arises when the brain and body do not agree.  Clinical psychologists hypothesize that the psyche of all men and women are innately androgyne (i.e., having the characteristics of both genders). The Jungian contention is that every human being is, in essence, a psychological androgyne, and much of the individuation process consists in making this androgyne explicit or conscious. Through cultural processes, however, most boys grow up to be fully \"masculine\" men and most women mature into fully \"feminine\" women. According to this hypothesis, these people reconcile the \"residue\" of their opposite gender traits through a variety of \"acceptable\" means. However, for people who are Androgyne, this residue is significant with strong characteristics, which are manifested to varying degrees.  What is the sexual orientation of person who is Androgyne? Sexual identity, sexual orientation and gender identity are independent of each other, thus a person who is Androgyne can be at any place on the sexuality spectrum as in any other part of society. The internal integration of a person who is Androgyne does not imply overt changes in one's physical [e.g. sexual] characteristics. Although sexuality and identity are intimately interwoven, the confusion arises where the condition is equated with sexual orientation. The fact of the matter is that the condition refers to one's gender condition as opposed to sexual orientation. The interchanging of the condition and sexual terms leads to confusion.  What does a person who is Androgyne look like?  Biologically speaking, a person who is Androgyne blends traits of both of the accepted polar sexes sometimes displaying an appearance that resembles more closely one of those sexes. Individuals merge characteristics in subtle ways with variations on presentation and social role, the details varying dramatically from person to person. They have an assortment of both masculine and feminine qualities, usually including features of stereotyped, culturally-sanctioned roles, per formative aspects, attributes, and/or behaviors expected of or considered appropriate for both genders. Both genders are natural to the expression of a person who is Androgyne, yet permanent polarization in either direction would likely bring significant unhappiness. Individuals who alter their secondary sex characteristics (genetically transmitted anatomical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics that first appear in humans at puberty and differentiate between the sexes without having a direct reproductive function) may not self-identify as Androgyne. An individual may accept the identification of Androgyne as consistency and permanency develops. Some people find a partial physical transformation of value, however, extreme actions regarding these issues are predominantly viewed with great caution.  Treatment  Current medical/psychological practice considers the Androgyne from the viewpoints of its sociobiological context (its relationship to the overall functioning of the individual in their social contexts), measuring the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment through outcomes expressed as improvements in the patient's quality of life and treating each patient according to their individual need rather than by a standard, prescriptive regimen of healthcare. There are a variety of sex and gender identity tests designed to measure both the mental, or brain sex of an individual, and the social gender conditioning that an individual has absorbed (the combined effect of nature plus nurture). These multifaceted tests oftentimes help individuals who are Androgyne understand themselves.  Some common misconceptions about Androgyne:  » A prevalent mistake without any factual or scientific support is the idea that there exist two separate and \"opposite\" genders, masculinity and femininity. Apart from the biological male and female functions of breeding, the terms masculine and feminine are culturally based ideas and not related to biology. A person who is Androgyne (sometimes called the third gender) chooses to live outside of socially prescribed gender roles, thus \"socially intermediate between male and female\". Intellectual and psychological adjustment, influences, role models, personal social environment, hormonal experience, anatomical variation, and even variations in one's personal sensuality play important parts in facilitating one's preference to take on the combination of traits, roles and attributes of male and female gender.  » Despite prevalent beliefs, people who are Androgyne do not have gender identity dysphoria (clinically diagnosed depression caused by the sex or sexual identity that one is born with) and do not necessarily have difficulties with their gender identities after identification and self-acceptance.  » People who are Androgyne rarely consider themselves to be members of the transgendered community.  Androgynes Are Not Men -- Nor Are They Women  It has been argued 1) that androgynes are not transgender(ed) in that they do not change their gender but remain the gender they were born with, 2) that they are not transvestites nor crossdressers in that they do not dress like the opposite sex since they do not have an “opposite sex” but sometimes dress like both sexes at the same time, and 3) that if one defines androgyne as someone who identifies as being half man and half woman, that could be interpreted as meaning that the person is neither man nor woman since 50% is an insufficient percentage to define something either way. Curiously, if one were to combine these three contexts, an androgyne would not be a man, woman, TV (Transvestite), CD (Crossdressers), TG (Transgender and/or Transgenderist), nor TS (Transsexual). What they are, however, is uniquely unified human beings of a sort that has been revered in many cultures for many centuries. More than 100 Native American tribes consider(ed) them to be shamans and call them two-spirits.", 11336, "Ev0APSTTaa", 1],

	136935 : ["For one thing sexuality is rushes of blood and erections while gender is behaviours, customs and the way people move their body. Gender is more social and less physical. Few feminists think they can think a beard onto their face but do think that they can work or take part in competitive sports i.e. a divide between the social and physical. This seems to be vindicated by the fact that gay men can exhibit either behaviours, customs or body movements as camp or straight acting inspite of the goings on in their pants. Another thing is the fact that homosexuality is so universal(even repressive countries like Iran) which working women,and home caring ones are not and are not even homogeneous. Edit. Whatever about the possible physical affects of brain on gender the point I was making is that an erection is a singular response to a stimulus while customs, roles and body language are a mesh of responses: They are a bundle of traits. Some which clearly don't add up. For example women are meant to be communicators which is essential in sports that need co-op sports and politics. But their is paucity of participation in both. Co-op Sports in itself is a bundle of traits, its not only being aggressive, but co-operative and communicative. So even if you could say that aggression(like sexuality) was biologically determined you certainly couldn't say that gender roles/gender or sport as a whole were. Theres definitely a clear cut qualitative leap there.", 11336, "USP1N6hJaa", 0],

	136940 : ["No, that would be a career suicide move. Look at everyone who stepped into HIAC with The Undertaker. Most of them got their career shortened and never be the same again. Look at Shawn Michaels who fell from the mid of the HIAC and got around 16 stitches. Also look at Mankind, who got thrown off top of HIAC and got his career shortened due to injuries after this match. Mankind had to retire from full time wrestling when he's still just 35 years old because of this match. And look at Big BossMan, he became a nobody after this match, just a mid carder who never got any attention. Also Rikishi, who was chokeslammed from top of the cell. Other than those, you can also look at Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, and Batista. All three of them lost a lot blood during their HIAC matches with The Undertaker. Also look at Edge who got chokeslammed from top of Ladder through the depth of hell and out for months after HIAC match. And later, CM Punk, who became a jobber for 2 years till 2011 when he recovered and started winning match again. CM Punk was never the same, he became far weaker and losing his ability to win matches for 2 years. And of course Triple H earlier this year, who got bloodied and couldn't get to his feet after HIAC match. Kane's the only man to survive HIAC match against The Undertaker. Kane is the only one who didn't get bloodied and was still the same after his HIAC match with The Undertaker in 2010. For those who said The Undertaker had poor record at HIAC, let's be objective. Out of his 5 HIAC losses, only 2 of them are clean. And 1 of them is 6 man HIAC where The Undertaker wasn't the one getting pinned. Only Brock Lesnar managed to beat The Undertaker cleanly in HIAC match. Other than that, Shawn Michaels beat The Undertaker at HIAC with help from Kane, Batista beat The Undertaker at HIAC with help from Edge, and Kane beat The Undertaker at HIAC with help from Paul Bearer. His poor HIAC record is because he got screwed in HIAC matches a lot. So, I wouldn't even dare to test The Undertaker into HIAC match. Although I could still possibly win and become famous, I won't take that risk. I would of course got bloodied with The Undertaker. I would never be the same man when the match is over. And most of all, I can't take the risk of getting my career shortened. Pros : If I win, I will be famous everywhere and will be known as a man who beat The Undertaker in his own game. It would even mean a lot more if I manage to beat The Undertaker clean. I will also earn respect from The Undertaker himself, like Brock Lesnar did in 2002. Cons : Even if I win, I would got bloodied and battered. I will also never be the same once I exit the HIAC cage, and I will suffer a lot of injuries that would shorten my career. But, most likely, without outside interference, I would got destroyed and lost the match. But, it will be a different story if I already become one of the greatest in the business, a guarantee first ballot WWE Hall Of Famer and a bonafide WWE Legend. If that's the case, then I had accomplished everything I want to in Pro Wrestling. I also know had all the \"EXPERIENCE\" to beat The Undertaker, so I would have the gut to challenge him. So, the only thing left was to battle The Undertaker for his Streak at Wrestlemania. And I would challenge him to a HIAC match at Wrestlemania like Triple H did. I wouldn't waste this opportunity to challenge The Streak, I would also do this in his speciality match. So, even if my career ends in this HIAC match against The Undertaker, that wouldn't matter much at all. I'm already a Legend and it wouldn't matter much if my career got shortened just a few years, since I'm not young anymore and already had a guaranteed ticket into WWE Hall Of Fame. BQ : Yeah, a bit, but not much. The only year when I found The Undertaker was so scary was in 1999, when he was the leader of Corporate Ministry. The Undertaker loved to kidnap and sacrifice other wrestlers then, and that make me so intimidated. Other than 1999, The Undertaker wasn't that much scary to me.", 11335, "kXrohLMjaa", 3],
