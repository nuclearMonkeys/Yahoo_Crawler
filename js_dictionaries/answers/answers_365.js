And Trump would never say anything racist toward black people \"publicly\" because he knows black people make up a large portion of the country and he wants them to vote for him too, even though he didn't do anything to stop modern oppression and I don't remember any other modern president doing much either, I guess the LGBTQ community is way more opressed, who knows.", 3245, "2Txq2y93aa", -6],

There was no protest or any hint of one. The next week there was to be a protest at Trump Tower Chicago. The police beat them back. like the police did in 1968. Mayor Lightfoot, the police commissioner are being investigated. It was said that how they handled it was wrong. The fools campained against Kim Fox on Jesse Smollett, but we thought that the draconian way she dole out sentences would hiave been her down fall. How about 30 days at Cook county jail for a broken window? 6 months in jail for thie flat screen. The police found out through social media that the criminals were using the protest as cover for their criminal activities. If that had not happened then maybe they would have had a stronger position. But since thiat happened and the criminals continue to use BLM protest as a backdrop for their criminal activites, defund the police is DOA.", 3242, "1edb7e285e1837d108c2caf03520c8bbaa", 1],

	19572 : ["Something to keep in mind: the vast majority of privately owned legally purchased firearms in American society have never and will never be used to take a life. Another fun fact, most guns used in crimes were not purchased through legal means.  I have mine because I like shooting and I hunt to put food in the freezer. I don't question why some people like to collect stamps or are car people or do yoga, I just accept they find it enjoyable and relaxing the way I like shooting. Hell, I consider shooting to be my meditation time.  And yes, I do have firearms for protection. I have a fire extinguisher, first aid kit, and firearms all for emergencies. I don't ever expect that I will ever have to USE them. Statistically it's unlikely, but it's better to have them and never need them then the other way around. I don't judge non gun owners for not owning. Your choices are just your choices. I respect that. So then why are many non gun owners trying to eliminate my right to own firearms? Modern art makes no sense to me and I don't like it. I find it to be annoying, but do you see me making a crusade calling for EVERYONE who does enjoy it to be forced to stop it? Nope, because I respect that others likes and dislikes are not my own, and that's ok.  I can't control what some criminal I have never met who lives 5 states away is going to do with a gun he stole. I can't control that a mental case got a gun and used it to commit a crime. I can't control other people. Just like I'm not responsible because some idiot decided to drink, get behind the wheel and crashed into a car killing a family.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good.

If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death.
