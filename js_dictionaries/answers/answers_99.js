With that I taught my kids all about drugs; the good and bad, the resulting lifestyles, pointed out the people. My kids don't do drugs. Now my buddy, who seemed stricter that hated drugs because of the impact they had on his life just told his kids NO. His kids have had a hard run of life; dope, stripping, litter of fatherless kids. I am certain canceling history only ensures a repeat.   People seeking to be offended will find offensive things everywhere. People that hate find hate everywhere. I've realized this over my life. With my wife: If I say, \"he is annoying and I don't want to see him today\" she later says I said, \"I hate him\". This sort of thing happened many times in fact. I had to teach her like a child, I can like and get along with someone I don't find perfect or wholly accept. At one point she decided I hate corn tortillas because I said, \"of course I want a flour tortilla for my burrito\". But it is also of course corn tortillas for tacos.  We obviously should just cancel criminals for the good of society but for some reason we don't. What makes me a better person if I just cancel my shortcomings? Don't they just continue to happen? I'd rather face them and grow. Giving me the choice to cancel my shortcoming and pretend it never happened ensures a repeat offense from me and others. Today's society runs on virtue signaling. Everyone just pretends they are not the problem. Hiding evidence of a problem is a good way to continue the problem. It's a codependent activity. Currently Nike, Coke and many other corporations are lobbying to retain slavery in China. Coke just asked white people to be less white. Isn't the narrative that white people like slavery?

If the game of push-pin furnish more pleasure, it is more valuable than either. Everybody can play at push-pin: poetry and music are relished only by a few. The game of push-pin is always innocent: it were well could the same be always asserted of poetry. Indeed, between poetry and truth there is natural opposition: false morals and fictitious nature. The poet always stands in need of something false. When he pretends to lay has foundations in truth, the ornaments of his superstructure are fictions; his business consist in stimulating our passions, and exciting our prejudices. Truth, exactitude of every kind is fatal to poetry. The poet must see everything through coloured media, and strive to make every one else do the same. It is true, there have been noble spirits, to whom poetry and philosophy have been equally indebted; but these exceptions do not counteract the mischiefs which have resulted from this magic art. If poetry and music deserve to he preferred before a game of push-pin, it must be because they are calculated to gratify those individuals who are most difficult to be pleased.\" - Jeremy Bentham ", 832, "None", 0],
