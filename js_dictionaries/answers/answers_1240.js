I was an \"entertainer\" for several years and still do an occasional now and then. Women's attitudesespecially sexually have changed dramatically over the years thanks to the society we are in now. Women are far more empowered sexually now than ever before. They have jumped on the wagon us guys have been riding since time began. They realize that there is no shame in enjoying their sexuality. I have found that during my shows (private bachelorette, birthday, etc.) it's the older women that really go crazy. But eventually I am always \"approached\" with offers for extra activities. It's always safe and just no strings casual one last fling type thing that really is meaningless. Nothing to worry about. Put yourself in those shoes. If you got all hyped up and horny and had to release that feeling, a quickie is just a quickie. So bottom line: YES but not to worry.", 8426, "None", -1],

It's pretty much for the same reason that men go to strip clubs (where women strip) because they get turned on, whereas when females go to strip clubs (where males strip) it's usually just as a joke/entertainment and getting turned on has very little to do with it. And I agree with the poster below me as well. I don't think men get it on with strippers at bachelor parties as much as concerned bride-to-be's tend to think. The stripper is there to dance; if it goes beyond that it's either an anomaly or else you have some very inebriated friends. Edit: It's amusing how many people who haven't studied social/gender sciences (and particularly human sexuality) answer as if they know the answer to this question, as if they have any basis for that answer. Men especially don't like to hear that many women are not as 'turned on' by the male physique (as opposed to their male counterparts in relation to the female nude form) and then they give a 'thumbs down' to anybody that dares to express that sentiment (which in fact has been studied at great lengths and has proven to be true).", 8426, "None", -1],
