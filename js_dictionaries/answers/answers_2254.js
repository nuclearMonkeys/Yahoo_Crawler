	118532 : ["Funk over Orndorff - \"Mr. Wonderful\" was pretty great, but not as great as Terry Funk. He also wrestled the business in the wrong direction (start in the WWF, go down to indies). Funk, on the other hand, payed his dues, won his titles, payed more dues, wrestled in indies... he did it all. And he did it well.  Dynamite over Hart - Well, I know it's a lost cause. Most people on these boards will say that Hart was a better worker, and one of the best of all time. I know a lot of people would disagree. Ric Flair would disagree, and tried to expose Hart as a not very interesting wrestler. I'll go with Kid here because Bret Himself has said on multiple occasions that Kid was \"pound-for-pound, the greatest wrestler who ever lived\".  Steamboat over Savage over Sting - I can't believe you forgot Steamboat. Maybe i'll look like an idiot if he pops up somewhere else in the brackets. Otherwise, you've just proven my point about him being completely underrated and overlooked. (Savage over sting). Savage could go for a while. A long while. Just ask Ricky Steamboat. Terry Funk also thinks Randy Savage was the first guy to ever put anyone through a table.  Malenko over Benoit - I think both guys were great wrestlers (obviously), and neither were particularly great on the mic. But Malenko was a bit better. And apparently, really funny backstage.  Hart over Angle - Angle's a great mat guy, etc. Owen could do it all, and likely would have had his career not been cut short.  Austin over Hogan - Well, I guess it takes one era-defining wrestler to eliminate another. I like Austin in all his incarnations, particularly as the last holder of the Million Dollar Belt. He could work, he could go, and he could certainly take Hogan.  HBK over Taker - Ooooh, here's a doozy. I think Taker's a good guy, but his career hasn't always been that solid. He's had some huge ups, but definitely a lot of downs in terms of wrestling ability. He often just relied on his gimmick to get over. For Michaels, I've never seen him get too lazy. He gets the win here, and revenge for a whole lot of pain caused by the dead man.  Flair over the Rock - I can't see anyone going the other way. I just can't.", 10548, "AA11854701", 1],

Hate to see Dynamite leave so soon, but the Hitman would just out-wrestle him and make him tap to the Sharpshooter. Sting.  A little better wrestler than Savage, I think.  Sting would win by submission to the Scorpion Deathlock. Chris Benoit.  Damn...what a match-up!  Chris' strength advantage would be the difference here.  Dean would eventually tap to the Crippler Crossface. Kurt Angle.  As great as Owen was, so is Kurt.  Kurt's meaner and more ferocious.  No submission here, Kurt would just have to wear Owen out and pin him. Hulk Hogan.  Hogan CAN wrestle.  He's bigger and stronger than Austin, too. The Undertaker.  Shawn's good, real good.  I just think the Undertaker can beat him. Ric Flair.  Flair had no trouble out-wrestling the big guys.  The Rock would be no different.", 10548, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", 1],

He was arguably the best WWF worker of the 1980s, and even brought Ultimate Warrior to a great match. The Rabid Wolverine manages to take this one out of his best friend's grip. I have a feeling that everybody's going to pick the massively overrated Angle, but I don't care. It's the King of Harts for me. Damn, Eddie didn't take it? Ah well, as consolation, we get a match between arguably the two best drawing wrestlers in WWE history. While it would be a terrible match today and both men's egos would never allow it to happen, no doubt this match could potentially draw like crazy. The Rattlesnake wins. A great match, but I've got to give it to Michaels. Bach. The Rock could work a crowd, but Ric Flair could work a crowd AND wrestle.
