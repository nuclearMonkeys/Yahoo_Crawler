Someone who views you as a priority makes time for you even when they have none and will sacrifice sleep and time for their self. My husband is a Cardiologist who works a good 70+ hours a week.  He still makes time for me even when he has none to himself.  He doesn't blow of my birthday or things that might be important to me.  He knows that like most people my birthday is the same date every year and the weekend before/after if we have plans for it he will make sure he's not working then.  Worse case scenario is he'd have another physician cover his on call for a few hours so he could take me to dinner at least (but in all likelihood I'd just forgo it at that point or do something a different day).  He could work 14 hours and be exhausted from work but he will still sacrifice the sleep to listen to me complain or vent something even if the problem is him and even if there's absolutely nothing he can do or offer the situation.  Say he had plans with me and then a friend of his would be in town for something and want to catch up with him..  he will tell them no.  He's never cancelled plans with me for someone or something else.  He was also like this when we were dating.  Aside from his job, he puts me before anything and anyone.

If your kids are in their 20's and you're 47 now that means you had kids in your early 20s with a man who was in his late 40's or early 50s. These May December relationships are destined to have things unfold in such a way. You now realize you have nothing in common with a 70 year old man and a sexless marriage. Just divorce your husband and find a man your own age.  Your business partner is cheating on his wife and sounds like trash. This is a ticking time bomb *This is a cautionary tale for all the young women in their late teens and 20s who laugh in the face of women in their 30s and 40s and have old men pursuing them for their youth and they can't even see what's coming until they get older and get stuck with an old man they have nothing in common with.

Most women don't have the capacity to appreciate what you do for them, all these things are just expected of you as a man, which is why this woman has the mindset of \"everything is perfect, BUT I can't seem to look past this one little thing\" that's because none of the things he does are truly appreciated, it's just expected.

Finally, you can provide some input into the bachelorette, but you're too involved when you say you'll plan it yourself.  Your role is to wait to see if/when someone offers to do this.
