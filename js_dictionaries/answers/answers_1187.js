	64858 : ["Trump was about my 7th choice as far as the lot of 17 candidates running for the GOP nomination. Still, he's the one who won the nomination.  And my two top issues are the Economy, which includes things like tax policy, jobs, wages, and trade, and Gun Rights. On the Economy, I've read a review of his economic plan and I think it will prompt robust economic and job growth. On Gun Rights, Hillary has already essentially declared war on the 2nd Amendment in several ways, from supporting Australian style gun confiscation to saying SCOTUS got their ruling on the 2nd Amendment wrong and the fact that as President, she would likely add 2 anti-2nd Amendment justices to the Court. Trump on the other hand has gone to the NRA twice now, and said that he supports gun rights. And on Illegal immigration, which is maybe #4 on my list, Hillary basically wants open borders and Trump wants to shut it down.  Again, I agree with Trump.", 8277, "d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa", 0],
