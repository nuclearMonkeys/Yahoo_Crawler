	137679 : ["hi KING, this is THE DARK EMPEROR,  i hope that you are doing okay. here is the answer to your first question: i do agree with you that judas was getting a big push before the lost to christian cage, but maybe TNA was stuck at a crossroads when they put that match the impact before against all odds. i mean, when they did that, they were basically stuck with two options: 1. have cage win and keep his momentum going into his world heavyweight title match with kurt angle or 2. they have judas win and keep his undefeated streak going heading into the against all odds event and quite possibly killing the momentum that cage had. now looking back, i can see that there could have been a third option: have kurt angle interfere in the match and cause cage to lose to mesias. playing it like that, i could see how that would not only keep the streak alive, but also give even more momentum to cage going into his match against angle. but since that has been done countless times, i can see where TNA probably did not want to go that direction. so in essence, since christian is the bigger star in TNA, they probably thought that this could be a way to put the first loss on mesias's record without really hurting the push that he had. they will probably will have them two rematch in perhaps the coming weeks and they will probably and hopefully let mesias win that match. answer to question two: 2. as far as the tiger mask vs aj styles match is concerned, well that was a great match and it should have been on ppv, but i believe that they were just seeing how they would work well in the ring together and maybe set up a program with them sometine in the future. i mean, look at all of the great angles, storylines, and rivalries that have started like that. look at the program that the rock and TRIPLE H had with one another. if my memory isn't foggy, i think that their first singles match was on the now defunct WWE show: shotgun saturday night. look at program between the rock and stone cold steve austin. if i remember correctly, i believe that their very first interaction with one another was at the slammy awards the night before Wrestlemania when the rock beat austin by a slim margin for the award of newest sensation. that could have been the catalyst for the rivalry that they had. look at TRIPLE H and the undertaker. i think that their first match against each other was on an episode of shotgun. look at TRIPLE H and shawn michaels. their very first match against each other was on an episode of RAW. it went from a RAW match to a brutal hell in a cell match at bad blood which in my opinion was the greatest hell in a cell match of all time. what i am trying to say is that some of the greatest programs between wrestlers that has ever been done in wrestling history have been done when they have first put them against one another at a smaller venue or a regular televised show to see if they can work well together and see if there is enough potential to see perhaps if they can do a program with one another. that was probably the thought process of TNA when they booked that match on impact. but hey, that is just my opinion.", 11361, "EMKL3xyXaa", 0],

	137704 : ["Ok here we go... 1)Robert Roode vs DH Smith-Scaffold Match Even if i haven't seen so many Robert Roode's matches and i can't have a complete opinion on him,i find him really powerfull,agile anc charismatic..DH Smith is in my opinion one of the best upcoming stars and if he does not get suspended again for taking steroids and violating the wellness policy..he has an amazing bright future along with Dibiase Jr. and Teddy Hart(but unfortunately he got fired again for being immature)..Between the two,i see DH Smith prevailing in the scaffold match and he will grab a huge momentum victory between the battle of future main eventers... 2)Natalie Neidhart Vs Beth Pheonix vs Awesome Kong Vs Gail Kim No doubt about it,Awesome Kong has the size advantage..she is massive,huge and at some point unstoppable..she reminds me of Mark Henry in female division..and hell if she is gonna splash you..you are dead meat!Beth Phoenix has proved to be a bad@ss..really physical strength,reminds me of Chyna at some point(on wrestling ability wise)..she has a huge variety of awesome moves and i find her really entertaining!With her power and determination,she can overcome every opponent that will get in her way..even the one that listens to the name of Awesome Kong.Gail Kim is awesome,she has proved herself bith in WWE and TNA that she is gifted woman for wrestling..she has a good finisher..tough moves..she is agile and very quick..great combination for a wrestler but i don't think she will find a way to walk out as winner of the match...Nattie is upcoming,even though i would have prefered to see her as member of the Hart Foundation 2.0(didn't happen because of Teddy of course)..She is powerfull,she has showed a great amount of charisma and that will help her in the near future to establish herself to the business..so she won't have to make a playboy shoot to stay in the main events (cough ashley cough)!!From the 4,i choose Beth to win the match..because even though she might not have the most experience in that match..but in the combination of all factors(gimmick,skills,charisma,power e.t.c) she is better all around wrestler in that match..and she is in the top of her game right now even if she does not hold the womens championship anymore..(thanks to mickie james) 3)Chris Jericho Vs James Storm-Ladder Match That would definetely be a blockbuster match!!Lance Storm is an ECW Originals,he had a great run especially at ECW and along with Justin Credible and Dawn Marie had an awesome stable..the Impact Players were the won several times the tag team gold with various entertaining matches!He has for real fantastic wrestling ability(what do you expect from a guy that was trained by Stu Hart)..with variety of suplexes and he had a great combination of technique and speed.He reminded of Benoit at some point of his career..From the other hand you have Y2J..what can you say about him??even if he is not in the best shape of his career these days..his history owns..awesome wrestler..great technical...he can make a match a classic and he was definetely underrated till some point of his career..One of the best technical wrestlers of all time in my opinion..and since the match is gonna be a ladder match..it will definetely kick @ss!!I will give the victory to Lance Storm as Dawn Marie will come to the ring distract Y2J..Credible will hit him with the singapore cane from behind and Storm will grab the belt while everyone will be boooing!!I do believe though that Y2J is better than Storm(but i gave him the ladder match victory) 4)Sting Vs The Undertaker-Last Writes Match One of my dream matches..I am not a huge STing fan but i respect him so much because of his work ethic,his contribution to wrestling and because of his repeatitive rejections to join WWE back in the day..He has a very good wrestling ability..he became an Icon and his gimmick sell a lot.I like his Scropion Death Lock finisher and his Death drop too!He is one of the most inspirational wrestlers in history of wrestling!!Talking for inspirational wrestlers...you can't converstate without name The Phenom of the WWE...The Undertaker..he is my favorite wrestler of all time..because his gimmick simply owned..perharps the best gimmick ever..hsi wrestling ability is awesome..even if he is not the best ever..he is still executing new moves and he is willing to expand with moveset with the Triangle Choke..Gogoplata e.t.c!Plus,you can't easily find a 6ft10 guy to do a suicide dive over the top rope at the age of 43..he is simply amazing and legendary..the whole wwe shows are surrounded by his name and his wrestlemania streak speaks by itself...Thousand of accomplishments and good mic skills..when he was using them as the Big Evil!Between the two...it would be a blockbuster match up..but i will have to give the victory to The Undertaker... 5)Edge Vs Christian-One Fall Hmmmm...real life best friends,kayfabe brothers...interesting!!Edge has proved that he has the charisma to be one of the best heels..he sells his heel gimmick very much..he has a heal heat and the something special that can make a whole arena hate him..i remember when he was at Montreal for a show..he was cheered up so much..until he said that \"this is not Canada..only Toronto is the real Canada blah blah\" he made the whole arena booo in 2 secs!!haha..great heel..but in my opinion i don't find the so special thing about his wrestling ability!!He is a decent-good wrestler but nowhere near other greats!!As for Cage,i do believe that he is a better all around wrestler than Edge..he has better moves and he sells them better..He is charismatic and the reason that he didn't succeed as a main eventer in the WWE,was because WWE pushed him the wrong way...they had better babyfaces..so he never recieved big reaction as a face..and most importantly..since the biggest period he was a heel..he never got pushed the right way as a heel..he was more like a cowardish funny heel..instead of a heel that is determined and has heat..but he succeed in TNA and im happy about it..awesome wrestler like i said..and between the two..in one fall match..i will give the victory to Christian Cage...!! 6)Kane & Mick Foley Vs Abyss & a partner of your choosing. ok..let's make it..Kane & Mick Foley vs Abyss & Terry Funk.. Kane and Foley,i can see them working together good enough..they have done it before when Kane was masked kane as well!!Kane has a hell of a power..great physique..he is huge and he can get sadistic..i would love to see him with his old attire full mask back..way more intimidating than his current gimmick!!Foley...the guy is crazy..he might not have the best wrestling ability in the world..but he never disagreed to do a stunt..lots of guts..he has taken thousand of chair shots..lots of historic matches..(like the HIAC match at KOTR 1998 against Taker)!!i never liked the madible claw though especially when The Rock was overselling it!!Definetely a hardcore legend..he deserve that name...Abyss...he is a monster..he is powerfull and he is using lots of thumbtucks..so yeah..foley and abyss in the same match..we will get thousand ot tucks in the ring!!!I never liked him much to be honest,he is not special to me cause i have seen lots of better monsters than him,but he is good!!As for his partner Terry Funk..what can you say..the establisher of the hardcore wrestling..he is the teacher of Mick Foley..for sure the real hardcore legend..the one that has gave us so many classics at ECW..and the one that made people love hardcore wrestling!!Terry Funk deserves his own hall of fame and it pisses me off at times when people only crediting him for being a hardcore wrestler..For the record..Terry Funk is one of the best PURE wrestlers of all time as well..if anyone has seen his matches from NWA and other promotions..knows what im talking about..I will give the win to Kane and Mick Foley though..only because i considered them a better team overall..but the best in that match has to be Terry Funk... 7)Vince McMahon Vs Jim Cornette-Falls Count Anywhere Vince McMahon...ehhh...an all around well reknown wrestling persona!!I like his gimmick to be honest..he keeps the fans in active..he had an epic rivalry with Stone Cold and i loved the segments from back in the day...he was never a chicken to get humiliated(either by DX when they shove his head into Big Show's @ss and numerous other times or by Stone Cold on thousand occasions) to get ratings..he was never a chicken toput his body on the line against his best wrestlers..like on Valentine's Day against Stone COld in a cage match..or against HBK at Wrestlemania 22 and a lot more..he has proved that he is tough!!From the other hand Cornette is a commentator,manager and blah blah..i don't think that he has any chances against Vince..unless if the entre TNA interfere for his favor..then the WWE will come out to help Vince..and they start a battle..wow 50 TNA and 50 WWE guys at the same time in the arena..that would be chaos!!but yeah Vince wins..!! 8)AJ Styles Vs Jeff Hardy That would be an interesting match..I am not a Jeff Hardy fan...although at times he can be pretty entertaining..his wrestling ability is ok but nothing special..but he can offer a good amount of entertainment in a big match situation..plus he has some strong fanbase..i hate because he likes to screw over his chances to become a top star by getting suspended and stuff like that..He has done it so many times..and it's becoming unfair for him and of course his fans that supporting him from the beginning!!As for AJ Styles,my opinion is clear...he is one of the best wrestlers in the world today..he is absolutely phenomenal...he is a great high flyer..quick..agile..tough...charismatic.. he has lot of things that others need a lifetime to get!One of my favorite wrestlers at the moment and i hope i will see him on the TNA main events and holding a title some t", 11365, "jTc3qyOGaa", 1],

	137706 : ["Robert Roode.  I don't think Smith has been in as many gimmick matches, and Roode is the hungrier athlete.  Roode wins. Awesome Kong.  Beth is really the only one that can match strength with Kong but she is much smaller.  Unless all three can work together (which I very much doubt) Kong wins with an \"Awesome Bomb\" on Neidhart. Chris Jericho.  Storm is good but he has nowhere near the experience in Ladder Matches Jericho has.  Good match-up, though. The Undertaker.  The Undertaker is nearly unbeatable in gimmick matches.  Sting doesn't have THAT much experience in gimmick matches.  This match is right up the Undertaker's alley.  A fantasy match-up, to be sure.  I think the Undertaker would win this particular match. Christian.  A favorite dream match of mine.  Since breaking out on his own Christian has proven he is main event caliber, wrestling animals such as Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe.  Christian keeps getting better; Edge has seen his better days.  Christian is the better wrestler.  Edge's strength advantage wouldn't help because Christian has been wrestling guys stronger than Edge.  A great, hard-fought match.  Christian wins with the \"Frog Splash\" (not the \"Unprettier\"). Abyss and his partner.  Abyss needs somebody who can neutralize the big Red Monster so he can concentrate on Foley.  So Abyss calls up the greatest brawler in wrestling history to be his partner.  Bruiser Brody more than neutralizes Kane as they wind up brawling all over the building, leaving Abyss to go after Foley.  A vicious brawl ensues with Abyss finally putting Foley away with the \"Black Hole Slam\". Vince McMahon in an easy match.  Cornette can out-talk and out-promo Vince, but not out-fight him. AJ Styles.  AJ would know to keep this one in the ring and on the mat as much as possible, where he has the advantage over Jeff.  He can't out-quick or out-crazy Jeff, he'd have to out-wrestle him.  AJ with the \"Styles Clash\" for the pin. Samoa Joe.  This type of match doesn't favor Angle or Orton.  Angle can't brawl very well, and Orton doesn't have much experience in these types of matches.  Triple H does.  So does Joe.  Neutral ground (no \"writer's advantage\"), Joe will out-brawl Triple H and take the gold. WQ:  I hope not.

	137716 : ["1- Robert Roode vs DH Smith - Scaffolding Match - Robert Roode takes this match, quite easily at this point in time, DH Smith does not have the experience to take out Roode yet, I think maybe in a few years, I would not be able to call this match, but right now, the match belongs to Robert Roode, pushing DH Smith off the scaffolding. DH Smith has a long way to come to reach a level that roode has achieved, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that DH Smath will reach the level that Robert Roode has, if not surpass it. However for now the score will stand with Roode taking a victory over DH Smith in this scaffolding match! Roode & TNA win 2- Gail Kim vs Awesome Kong vs Beth Pheonix vs Natalya Neidhart - Fatal 4 Womens Match - Though all these are great wrestlers, I think that Gail would be eliminated first, because of the size difference between her and the other girls being as large as it is, I think Beth and Natalya would take out Awesome Kong by working together in this match at least for a period of time long enough to get the victory assured  for their company. Natalya and Beth would fight it out after, giving Beth the win for this year, next year by this time I would presume that Natalya would take this bout, but that is only an assumption, currently, the winner would in my mind be: Beth Pheonix, giving WWE their first win. Chris Jericho and James Storm would put on an amazing show, probably one of the best I would have ever seen! I think that this is one of the closest matches that you have listed on this card. They are both great mat wrestlers and can both pull off a few cool aerial moves, that has been proven by both of them, but I think that when they take to the heights in a Ladder Match Chris Jericho steals not only the edge in this match but also a win for WWE. Sting vs Undertaker.... Very difficult to judge and both men are around the same age in their careers, both are mat wrestlers, but taker has size and strength to his advantage, being a brawler really would come in handy in this match for Undertaker, and he hits a big uppercut on sting, going up for the chokeslam, and no, Sting still has life left in him, Taker goes for the tombstone, and connects: 1, 2, Sting got a foot on the ropes!. Undertaker sends Sting on his last ride for the three count, and Undertaker gave Sting his last rights alright. This was probably the hardest match for me to call, with both men having such great long lasting careers and such a love for the business, but I think Undertaker would indeed win because of his size and strength advantage and that he has preserved his gimmick over the years, whereas Sting hasn't as much as Undertaker has. Edge vs. Christian, in a normal match, how very difficult this match is. I think that both of them are excellent wrestlers and both being pushed by WWE and TNA respectively, is a good thing, and a wise move by the companies, I think this would be one of the best matches of all time. I don't think there would be able to be just one winner. I think the general public views Edge better because he is in WWE, not TNA and has held more titles, but that means nothing to a match like this, I personally think Christian is better, but cannot quite decide on a clear winner so; I think that this contest would end with a double countout after Edge speared Christian to the outside, but hit his head on the barrier wall. -DRAW- Kane and Mick Foley, two of the most extreme people wrestling has ever seen, versus, Abyss and Raven... now I must say, Mick is not the best wrestler I have ever seen, but he can kick out after just about ANYTHING and that will give him a great advantage in this match. Kane can take damage, but also deal it out, Abyss in my mind is a mixture of the previous two. and Raven is really unpredictable, giving him a pyschological effect over the WWE team here. Now, Im going out on a limb here and saying that this is a normal match. Mick Foley just gets thrown around in the match and Raven ends up using Mr. Socko on Foley towards the end, taking him out of the match and aken goes for a double chokeslam  but only succeeded to get Raven up and slam him, abyss and kane go out at, Kane gains the upperhand and goes to the chokeslam but Raven comes in with a chair and takes Kane down, disqualifying team TNA, team WWE takes the win, I think after the match TNA's team would take a commanding vigil over team WWE though... Vince McMahon is easily in better shape then Cornette, and has the larger company behind him, and owns his own company, Vince takes this bout with no effort, except when he tried to pick Cornette up. Vince owns his own show, and Cornette helps run one, that was the main deciding factor for me in the match-up and that is why Vince was the one who won. AJ Styles may not have the in ring strength over Hardy, but he does have the quickness and unpredictablity far beyond Jeff Hardy's I think that AJ would end up giving TNA a win by  Finally getting the advantage on Jeff Hardy then using the turnbuckles to keep that advantage, finishing him off with a pay-lay, and a styles clash, match over, TNA wins. Triple H has no backstage power for a mixed company, no matter how many fans love him. So he does just average in this match as he is getting up there in age. Samoa Joe does exceptionally well up until he gets the RKO, basically removing him from the match, it would all come down to Randy Orton and Kurt Angle in my eyes, now Angle is the better wrestler, and is taking Randy to school by using technical moves, but out of nowhere comes that RKO for the three count, WWE takes the main event. Final Tally: WWE: 6 TNA: 2  DRAW: 1 WQ:  I doubt the Undertaker will return as a biker, that gimmick did not go over very well for him and he was not pushed hard in it, Taker is main eventing right now perfectly fine, and the gimmick isn't getting boring for me anyway, I think that they will have him return the way he was, or maybe as vintage undertaker. Undertaker will hopefully return with more of an edge though and take out some vengeance on his victims! I think they shouldn't fix gimmicks that are not broken but should instead fix the ones that are. Work on what needs fixing first. All in very close matches though, enjoyed answering, thanks.", 11365, "f465949ca6b8b9f4a5d22b285b777b5daa", 6],

Our bodies are made mostly of saturated fats and monounsaturated fats. Therefor we need these fats more than polyunsaturated fats, though we still need those. Eating fat doesn't make you fat. Eating processed carbs and maintaining a sedentary lifestyle makes you fat. Fat also helps keep you satiated, which prevents overeating. So, yes, you can definitely gain weight only eating carbs and protein.", 11367, "DBP2T4LWaa", -1],
