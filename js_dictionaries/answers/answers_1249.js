With desktop PCs you can change or upgrade any feature you want to make it faster, where laptops are built as they are and can't really be upgraded as much. Desktops has alot more features than a laptop which makes them better for gaming as they are faster, and you can upgrade a graphics card whereas a laptop you cant.  Laptops can play some games, but not on max resolution. This is down to the graphics on the laptop. With a PC you can add or change the graphics card, but with a laptop the GPU is built onto the motherboard meaning it cannot be changed and is not as powerful as a graphics card. But like I said some games can be played on laptops and you just have to look out for the best CPU and GPU you can get.   If your mind is set on a laptop then I wouldnt recommend any of those for gaming. They are perfectly fine for web browsing, music and any work you do, but gaming is out the question unless you dont mind playing on low res. This is what I would recommend you get. These are high end specifications which would suite your needs just fine, and its affordable:   Processor: At least an Intel i3 (the i3, i5 and i7 are the fastest and best out so far for computers).  Motherboard/laptop: Asus are one of the best manufacturers for computers.  Hard drive: 500GB  RAM: Look for something between 6-8gb  GPU (Graphics): Anything on a laptop with an i3 processor will be fine.  Windows 7 operating system.    (This only has 4gb RAM but it should be fine).   Also look at the speed of the processor. The faster the better. This one has 2.4ghz which is pretty fast for a laptop.   I hope this has helped. If your going for a laptop look for those specs I have listed as they will be perfect for your requirements, and as you can see from the link its affordable too.

This problem started when Republicans took over in 1997 and people such as McCain's economic architect Phil Gramm in concert with John McCain who was chairman of the Senate Commerce committee removed all the protections that had been in place since 1932 to prevent a depression era meltdown again.  now think of the debacle this has caused and look at McCain saying that the financial deregulation model should be applied to health care.  the last one removed took place in 2005 when Republicans were still in control of both the house and senate and they removed the last vestige of protection which was the firewall that would have prevent investment corporations from doing exactly what they did thus imploding the way they did In fact the big thing that McCain likes to tout about wanting to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie mac was a shell game.

Also I am curious where you get any reliable information about the churchs finances since they are a non-profit and their finances are sealed and not public record.

You sound like a con so I'm sure you get upset with Obama over everything, but what bothers me is that Obama ran in 2008 talking a lot about all the times Bush43 crapped on the Constitution and America's reputation, but doesn't even bother to clean Bush's crap from the Constitution before adding a fresh pile of his own. What union are IRS employees a member of?  I didn't think they were in a union.  Thanks for reminding me of one of those times Bush decided to use the DoL against the unions by adding useless paperwork requirements to everything they do though.  The more I find out about this story, the more it seems the IRS was doing their jobs.  They scrutinized 298 groups, 98 of which were 'tea party' or conservative political groups, and the only one who was denied tax-exempt status was a Democrat organization.  After the Citizens supreme court case, every one of these PACs needs to face some scrutiny--or we just need to get rid of tax-exempt status for all of them and then the government has no business asking about what they do.  Can't ask the government for support and then ask them to leave you alone. In case you were wondering--I'm telling you that any concerned citizen should keep an eye on the government--especially when your guy is in there.  Obama expects republicans to whine about him and Bush expected Democrats to whine--if more democrats whine at Obama and if more republicans had whined at Bush for this kind of thing, then maybe they would all respect the Constitution instead of having an \"We won--stop us if you can\" attitude.", 8438, "AA11209233", -1],
	68016 : ["If you are believe that progressives give a damn about the Constitution beyond how they can use it to further their democracy agenda -- well, dream on. 8/31/1910 Osawatomie, Kansas, T. Roosevelt proclaims the progressive agenda -- national health care, social security and the championing of unions (the vanguard of all such movements) -- and discards the Constitution: “This, I know, implies a policy of a far more active governmental interference with social and economic conditions in this country than we have yet had, but I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO FACE THE FACT THAT SUCH AN INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT CONTROL IS NOW NECESSARY.” Dem. pres. Wilson (1913-21):  \"You are not here merely to make a living. You are here to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, and with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. YOU ARE HERE TO ENRICH THE WORLD. You impoverish yourself if you forget this errand.”  FDR's “Second Bill of Rights” included the “right”: to “earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation”; of every family to a “decent home”; “to be free from economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment.” (Speech to Congress on 1/11/44) LBJ's Great Society spent trillions on those “rights.” In fact, America's semi-capitalist system provided those “rights” in such abundance that millions of Europeans fled their welfare state nations to come here. But none of that matters to democrats. Their party now has what they want, a welfare-state America: -2/4/10 Gallup poll: 61% of liberals have a positive view of socialism. -6/2/11 Gallup poll: 71% of democrats favor re-distributing wealth. -9/6-9/2012   Those who want more government control over us: Republicans 15%; Independents, 29%; Democrats 67%. -Now they have national health care, the hallmark of all welfare and socialist states. Ben Franklin predicted all of it: \"When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.\"  We're now a democracy. Thomas Jefferson: \"A democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where 51% of the people may take away the rights of the other 49%.” Ben Franklin: \"Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.” Obama will nominate like-minded progressives to the Supreme Court who will affirm the democracy agenda. Corporations will vote for corporate welfare and government contracts. The welfare class will vote for more benefits. The government unions will push for bigger government because that means more unionized government union jobs. Our elites politicians will continue to give money to nations which are anti-American and welfare state nations that promote the democrat dream of an American utopia.  And the Constitution will not be there to protect freedom lovers.", 8438, "None", 3],

	68022 : ["Well, stiggo629 does bring up an interesting point and it is that very point that the original ruling is based on.  Under the original case, woman had the right to act in such a way to preserve their life (meaning the right to live) and can make their decision how they see fit.  The big problem with this is our rights in the law/constitution are only valid provided they don't violate the rights of another person.  Which is the shaky ground this ruling is based on. Can anyone honestly state when a unborn child becomes human being?  No and here is why.  The main characteristics that separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom is self awareness (self consciousness as some call it).  No scientist can state when this occurs.  What they do say is it occurs at some point after conception (notice I didn't say birth).  And since we science can define when an unborn fetus becomes a \"human being\", then it should be banned.  Ignorance of a matter is never an excuse to do something.  If you think otherwise, tell an officer that you didn't know the speed limit and see if you will get out of the ticket.  Until people are ready to make a provision so that anyone (both mother and doctor) are held responcible for killing a child once science has clearly defined it (whether that is 8 weeks or 18 weeks), then it should be illegal.  That is, if science were to define it as 12 weeks, everyone who agrees to (the mother) and performs (doctors) an abortion should then be brought up on 1st degree murder charges for that is what they have committed.  Of course this sounds out there, but think about it for a minute. In this matter I would have to say Number 2.  The original case was made to allow for abortions to save the woman's life.  Medicine has advanced well beyond the need for such a procedure to save the life of the mother.  Last year there was a premature delivery done because of medical complications endangering the life of the mother at 21 weeks.  That infant survived and is now nearly a year old.  It was done to save lives, then additional rulings have now changed it to nothing more than another form of birth control so that people don't have to take responcibility for their own actions.
