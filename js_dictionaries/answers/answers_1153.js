Some pigments are water soluble and some are not, alcohol can be used as a solvent for some kind of compounds that water can not solve. in addition salt gives extra properties to the water due the ions that it has, so extra electric forces attract or repel pigment molecules", 8196, "0e7ef873a78a24658200b5e4f2b7e6bdaa", 0],

	63149 : ["I only have their greatest hits, but I always loved \"Break on Through\", it's really dark and heavy (I bet esp for its time) but it sounds catchy too. BQ1: probably the debut, or LA Woman, since it has most of the songs I know. BQ2: tossup with that song or Hello I Love You, maybe Riders on the Storm too.", 8191, "zsCLbJqsaa", 1],
	63150 : ["Here, I will give you a simple run through of all the albums so you can decide which one you think you would enjoy the most. First was their debut album which you already covered so I will skip that one.  Strange Days- This is their second album, and as the name suggests, has an eerie unique sound. Strange Days has some really good songs on it. There are the greatest hit ones, When the Music's Over, Love Me Two Times, People are Strange, and Strange Days. Aside from the hits there are some other great songs such as Moonlight Drive, My Eye's Have Seen You, and Horse Latitudes. Those are just a few of the other good ones, because this is the type of album that you put on, and don't ever skip to the next song, because they are all so good. (this was my first real album by the way) waiting for the Sun- People have criticized this album for having the third album syndrome, having The Doors completely change to a more pop feel because they ran out of songs. It was also during the height of Drinking Jim's days. Most fans say that this is the worst, but I disagree, thinking that although it is a different part of The Doors it is still good.  The well known songs from this are Hello I Love You (number one single), Five to one,The unknown Soldier, and Spanish Caravan . There are some gems on this too. There is my favorite song, Not To Touch The Earth (very trippy), Summer's Almost Gone, My wild Love, and Love Street.    The Soft Parade- The best way to describe this album is insane :) Every song has some twist to it, some type of vocal or instrument that is way different. The popular songs are Touch Me, and Wild Child. The crowning glory of the album is The Soft Parade, a long song that uses various studio techniques and instruments for a truly unique song, Jim's lyrics are also incredible. The other good songs are Wishful Sinful, and Tell All the People. I love this album, but most common, or casual Doors Fans say it is over instrumentalized (sorry I can't spell) with the strings and horns and all of that. In a way, I agree it is a bit much, and we are missing part of our Doors, but it is still great in it's own way.  Morrison Hotel- This is my absolute favorite Door's album. Jim also said in interviews that it was also his favorite. This has more of a blues feel , and besides Waiting for the Sun is the only album with no song over 7 minutes. This was a back to basics for The Doors. After all the struggles with Waiting, and Parade this was their chance to become The Doors like they were in the early years, and have a fresh start. I love every song on Morrison Hotel, but I will try to only name a few. Roadhouse Blues is the single for the album. Waiting for the Sun (the song), and peace Frog are also well known. There is also Queen of the Highway (a favorite) Blue Sunday, Maggie M'Gill, You Make Me Real, and many more. This album is great if you like a blues mixed with rock type sound. LA Woman- People usually agree that this was the best album from The Doors. It is along the lines of their first album in popularity and prestige. As you probably know, this was their last album together with Jim. The sound is hard to describe, it is a sort of unique classic mixed with a blues and jazz. The hits are Riders on the Storm, LA Woman, and Love Her Madly. There are some great other songs too like Hyacinth House (probably my second favorite song), The Changeling, Crawling king Snake, and Been Down so Long. Again this is the type of album that you don't skip any songs because they are all so good. Based on what you said your interests are, I would suggest LA woman for you to buy. Morrison Hotel is my favorite though, so I am going to suggest that one too because it is a great album. Any one that you pick, you will not be disappointed, as they are all fantastic in their own genre or way. Make sure you tell me which one you pick too, I would like to know :)", 8191, "pljzOzReaa", 10],

	63156 : ["There is no such thing. I get tired of people bashing bands and individual artists for \"selling out\". What are they in the business for if its not to make a living and support their families? Take Chris Broderick for example. People bash him all the time for joining Megadeth. They say he sould have stayed with Nevermore. Okay, lets do the math. You are in the band Nevermore. How many albums have they sold? How many arenas can they sell out all across the globe? I would say less than a million and none. Now take Megadeth. They have sold millions of albums and can sell out most arenas in America, Europe, South America, and Asia. They are world known and make tons of cash. Countdown to Extinction has sold more albums than probably the whole Nevermore Cataloge combined. Now you are Chris Broderick. You can either stay with your go nowhere make no money band, or you can play lead guitar next to Dave Mustaine and make millions. OH GEE, WHAT DO I DO?? The word SELL OUT is stupid when refering to a band. What is the point of wanting to become a famous musician if you have to have a day job painting billboards? PS. Yes Metallica are sell-outs.

Karyote is based on the numerical solution of a set of reaction-transport equations underlying the kinetics of genomic, proteomic and metabolic processes (see figure). It is integrated with a variety of experimental data types through our novel information theory approach; the result is an automated procedure for tailoring Karyote to a given cell type and that all predictions are accompanied by an assessment of uncertainty. Karyote also serves as a data archive with self-consistent automated interpretation of the expanding genomic, proteomic, metabolic and other information. Through our information theory framework, incompleteness in Karyote can be compensated for with time series data; complex data sets can be automatically synthesized and integrated. In this way Karyote is an end-to-end cell modeling system. Karyote has great potential for accelerating drug discovery, optimizing treatment regimes, testing concepts in cloning and designing microbes for biotechnical and environmental remediation activities. The information you input to Karyote can be kept proprietary or may be released to other users. You may export models as SBML files. You may delete your information from our files at any time.
