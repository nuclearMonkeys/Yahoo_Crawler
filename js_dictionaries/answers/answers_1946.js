	103060 : ["It isn't true that the Jews \"went mad\" over \"The Passion of Christ\" but there was an amount of criticism, some from Jewish groups, more from the PC merchants. This was for various reasons: - Mel Gibson's father was a notorious Holocaust denier in the USA and Australia. This has rubbed off on the son. Remember his drunken anti-Semitic rant when arrested. - The representation of the High Priest and the Sanhedrin was considered by some as anti-Semitic. Having seen the film myself I would say that their apparently implacable hostility to Jesus was motivated by fear that Jerusalem would explode into revolt, giving the Romans an excuse to massacre its inhabitance. - Of course this is never stated in the film, which is based on the Gospel of St. Matthew. The Gospel itself does highlight the role of the Jewish Elders in Christ's conviction. However the Gospel was written after the Jewish Revolt of 70AD. It was important for the tiny \"Jewish\" Jesus Cult to differentiat itself from the rebellious Jewish mainstream. Hence the antipathy to the Hebrew establishment.", 9836, "None", 0],

Children are too innocent to be anything more then little mean children in Elementary school, with thin skin and newly discovered levels of tempers and jealousy. By the time they get to middle school, then think they know it all, and the sad truth of it is, they know more then they should, about sex, drugs, 'the ideal body image', but they are still little kids. They still lash out at each other like the grade school kids often do, but now they have more knowledge on how to pick at someone's insecurities. Their skin is still thin, but they have learned to try and keep it to themselves the best they can, else the wolves will smell the blood. High school these children are starting to learn. The ones that did the picking are now getting picked, and the ones that got picked on are old news, 'so, like, who cares?' lol Its the circle of life in the education system and we are forced to go through it, forced to put our children through it, but in reality, we are so much more prepared for life then say, a home schooled child who has only known the annoyance of a sibling.

If you get involved with anything short of a physical alteration, someone's gonna smell blood and your boys gonna get bit again. I'm sure he's a smart kid.
