Some Blacks bought this separation as a means of presenting themselves as the \"poor black people\" when no other collection of \"Ethnicities\" seems to find no significance in the Hispanic Race nor the Asian Race BS being sold.", 3124, "xgkTMnXHaa", 1],

This is what voting for Republican candidates gives you. But you won't get them unless you vote FOR them. Besides, voting for president has the single biggest impact on what the federal government does.

Proving you have the right to vote is much like having to possess a license to drive which is also not racist.
