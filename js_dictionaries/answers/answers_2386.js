That is why we all must be discreet if we do not know about the country and the laws.  Jehovah is a fair and just God, in fact \"perfect justice\" is what he is described as. Deut. 32:4; Ps. 37:28; Isa. 61:8; Heb. 2:2.....That is why we can have all the confidence in the world that the \"good news\" will be know before the end of this system.

Some places are using 4-5 year old information to preach with, some just the Bible. They meet where they can, whenever they can. Some in the woods, some in basements but they are still gathering together. They encourage all by remaining strong and relying on Jehovah for strength during these hard times.", 10827, "mZelOaiEaa", 6],
	125115 : ["I had an acquaintance at one time. He went to China, in clandestine, to speak about the Christ. In China you can go to jail for making disciples. What he told me is there is more preaching going on in China than you might think. He was not one of Jehovah's Witnesses, but he did tell me he saw Watchtower magazines and other publications from Jehovah's Witnesses in China. The Good news of God's kingdom has been preached in Russia for decades and decades.  I read a few paragraphs from a Jehovah's Witnesses (our) Yearbook. The paragraphs were about a tourist on a very remote Island in the Pacific Ocean. A local, an indigenous islander, became one of Jehovah's Witnesses. The tourist, while visiting the Island, was approached by our brother, so that our brother could give a witness to God's kingdom to the tourist. The tourist was floored, because, as he told the local, he came to the Island to get away from Jehovah's Witnesses and their preaching work. P.S. Jehovah's Witnesses, in the event that countries like China, or others, open up to the preaching work about God's kingdom, we will definitely be in these countries, whether they're rich or poor countries.", 10827, "83QxTKYZaa", 3],
	125116 : ["Jesus foretold: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) The good news about God's Kingdom is of utmost importance. Why, it is the most important message in the world! In over 100,000 congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses earth wide, about seven million servants of God are engaged in an unparalleled preaching work, telling others that the Kingdom has been established. Its establishment is good news because it means that God has set up a government in heaven to take full control of earth's affairs. Under Kingdom rule, Jehovah's will is going to be done on earth as it is in heaven. Think of some facts related to that detail of Jesus' prophecy. The number of people proclaiming the good news was very small when the last days began in 1914. By now that number has grown to huge proportions. There are more than 7,000,000 Witnesses of Jehovah preaching throughout the earth, organized into more than 100,000 congregations. An additional 10,000,000 people gathered with Jehovah's Witnesseson the occasion of the Memorial of Christ's death. That was a significant increase in attendance over the preceding year.  What a mighty witness about God's Kingdom is being given in all nations before this system's end comes! That is despite the fact that Satan is “the god of this system of things.” (2 Cor. 4:4) All political, religious, and commercial elements of this world as well as its propaganda channels are being influenced by him. What, then, accounts for the amazing success of the witness work? It has to be Jehovah's backing. Thus, the Kingdom-preaching work proceeds marvelously despite Satan's attempts to stop it.  The success of the Kingdom-preaching work and the growth and spiritual prosperity of Jehovah's people can be described as a miracle. Without God's support, which includes his guidance and protection of his people, the preaching work would not be possible. (Read Matthew 19:26.) We can be sure that with God's holy spirit working on the hearts of vigilant people who are willing to serve, this preaching work will be carried on to a successful conclusion, “and then the end will come.” That time is rapidly approaching.", 10827, "n3aUqSrqaa", 3],
	125117 : ["Matthew 24:14 does not say that every individual would have to hear the good news before the end. It says the good news will be preached for a witness to all the NATIONS. There isn't a country on Earth in which Jehovah's Witnesses have not at one time preached the good news of the kingdom. Jesus' words in Matthew 24:14 cannot be taken to mean that every nation or community would have to allow Jehovah's Witnesses to preach freely. In this regard, note what Jesus also said to his followers: \"When they persecute you in one city, flee to another; for truly I say to you, YOU WILL BY NO MEANS COMPLETE the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives.\" (Matthew 10:23, CAPS mine) So Jesus thus told his followers that they will not be welcomed to preach in every community and that they will not succeed in thoroughly witnessing to every community before the end arrives. I see Matthew 24:14 as meaning that the good news will be preached in every nation to the extent that individuals within the nations and the governments of the nations would allow -- every nation will be touched by it to some extent. And God will ensure that deserving individuals within all nations get to hear it. But God will not force his message on those who adamantly refuse to hear it. When you really think about it, even in countries where we have freedom to preach, the majority refuse our message or don't take it seriously enough. So the overall response is not necessarily better in free countries than in countries where the work is banned. It may be that whereas we have to do a lot of work to sift out the few deserving ones from the undeserving in free countries, the angels are more heavily involved in banned countries to ensure the few deserving ones get the message from our brothers' very discreet efforts.", 10827, "4kgESJlEaa", 2],

And actually, as of 2011, Jehovah's Witnesses are preaching this good news of the Kingdom in 236 lands worldwide.

In these countries the preaching work of Jehovah Witness is little if any. There are millions upon millions of people in these lands which have never been visited by a Jehovah Witness, yet the Watchtower society seems to continue concetrating efforts in the wealthy western countries, where people are visited constantly and constantly reject the advances of JWs.

	125120 : ["No because it is the PEOPLE that preach not the magazines or the buildings. The good news has reached all countries on the planet including the Middle east, and restriction in our public ministry does not mean we aren't there preaching discretely, there are hundreds of thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses in China and Russia. Jesus didn't mention the Watchtower (a convenient way of instructing people about bible truths) or the buildings he said the good news will be preached in all countries and, all praise to Jehovah, that has been accomplished.  Now Jehovah's Witnesses have preached in every land, when the extent is done to HIS satisfaction, he will say enough. Until then we will keep obeying his command, after all, if we don't who will? EDIT Not where are they GOING to congregate - they are ALREADY there, so where ARE they congregating? Jehovah's Witnesses in these circumstances are congregating in small groups in private homes.

They did however have a deep understanding of human nature which has not really changed that much. For instance, they knew that the government had to run in a secular setting. Not to diminish the right of each person to worship or not to worship as they please, They knew that most religions set standards of conduct that were beneficial to society. They knew if we allowed any religion or group within that religion to dictate policies which were counter to or effected negatively the beliefs or freedoms of others, whether these beliefs were secular or religious, there would be trouble. Human nature dictates that  \"My beliefs or feelings on any subject are the correct ones and everyone else should be made to conform.\"   The forefathers wanted our country to be ruled through debate and reason. They knew there would be those on the extremes of any cause. But through compromise and mutual respect we would meet in the middle. Our political parties must function like a coalition government.
