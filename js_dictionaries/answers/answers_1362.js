	73715 : ["Anything on your side from the weather head is the home owner's responsibility. You will have to have a service disconnect order and a reconnect order. This would be best done by a reputable, qualified and insured electrician. The wiring may have to be replaced down to at least the meter base. Usually the neutral wire MUST be continuous from the weather heat to the Electric Panel Disconnect/Main Breaker so it is possible it will also have to be replaced depending upon the Electrical Inspector. Read the following: ============================================== Selecting contractors: 1/ Look up local contractors first. work out from the closest to your location. If someone you trust has had work done similar to yours, ask them about the contractor they used. If they were completely satisfied with their  contractor(s), ask for their telephone number. 2/ Select at least 5 your are interested 3/ Do a google/yahoo search on each of the contractors you are interested in; look for praises (check who is writing the praises to see if they have any connection to the contractor <scam artists and coffident persons often work in groups> google/yahoo search the people giving the praise or references) 4/ When you are satisfied with at least 3 contractors per job, have them give you written estimates with details of work to be done, terms, guarantee(s), cost of extras (how much do they charge if they find something not covered by the contract), paymant schedules if necessary and whatever else you can think of to protect yourself. 5/ If the contractor tries to pressure you into signing the contract immediately with a high deposit (more than 15% - deposits over 10% normally are not paid untill material is delivered and left at your site) reject that contractor. Be careful, high pressure can be someone who sounds very convincing, but has many reasons why you should sign on the dotted line NOW. 6/ It is always good to have another adult with you when a contractor inspects the work to be done. 7/ If you do not get at least 3 written estimates signed by the contractor - not you (do not sign yet) , go back to 1. repeat until you get  written estimates signed by the contractor - not you (do not sign yet). Read the estimates over with some who has some knowledge of the work that has to be done. This may take longer than you thought; do not rush into it. Research, research, and more research helps.

He was the military official who signed the certification of Oswald's discharge papers being transferred from the military official mail system to a diplomatic pouch when he (Walker) was serving as Commander, U.S Forces Berlin. Some twenty minutes to a half hour after the shooting from the Sixth Floor Book Depository, a Dallas police officer exited his vehicle and yelled: \"Hey. Oswald!\". He knew Oswald because that police officer had certified delivery of the discharge papers to Oswald in person at the Marine Security Guard Detachment of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The police officer was a Marine Corps clerk at the time. His name is J.D. Tippett. There was one gunman.

	73736 : ["Each bank has their own short sale procedure. In answer to your question as to the time needed to prepare a HUD-1 statement, it take less than a minute. All the information to prepare a HUD-1 is defaulted to the HUD-1 statement if all the information is known about the mortgage loan, sale price, closing cost, down payment, interest and the number of years your mortgage is for. The question is the red tape and procedure the mortgage lender would use. If the HUD-1 is for a committee that meet each Friday at 1 P.M. that could be a hang up, If the procedure is to be reviewed by a short sale manager, that only look at these documents on Monday of each week , this could be a problem. The unknown factor is the procedures of Bank of America. Normally if you are paying all closing cost, the mortgage lender might be the final document needed to have a manager sign off on the short sale. You might consider giving your real estate agent a written document that would indicate if no answer or approval is received by May______, 2014 the transaction is null and void.

	73747 : ["Well, if you figure most places charge 20 to 30 dollars a day for boarding per dog depending on size. You will be doing what most kennels do. You let the dogs out for excercise, you feed and you care for them while the owners are away. You could charge them the same rates as kennels in the area. The gas costs would also be in the daily charge as you don't have to shoulder the running costs of an actual kennel business. So if you are taking care of two dogs I would charge them the same for one dog as you are making one journey for all the animals as they don't take up valued kennel space and you don't pay for the food etc. So for a small dogs and med is would be $20 to $25 per day and a big dogs it would be $30 per day. So you would be working roughly four days calculated at an eight hour day. So I would charge small dogs $80 med $100 large $120 for the total charge for all dogs in the house.

	73749 : ["This is not an easy question to answer. Are you buying a property that was foreclosed on or going through a short sale?  Some mortgage lenders are acting on behalf of an investor that purchased the mortgage note. The Bank of America could be acting as the agent that collect the mortgage loan. If this is the case, then perhaps all approvals might have to be approved by this note buyer (investor). This just add to the level of red tape. Most mortgage lenders are not the owner of the foreclosed property. In many cases the procedure of the mortgage lender would dictate the time frame in which many matters would take place. Your real estate agent might not be very helpful in this situation as, he/she would  ask for information that might or might be delivered in a timely manner. This is the only person between you and the seller, in this case, therefore ask any way.
