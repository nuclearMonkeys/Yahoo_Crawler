	121871 : ["Yes. To the American right anyone who's not in favor of social darwinism, the law of the jungle, is a socialist. That's the truth behind their lies and the attempt to demonize every social program or less than free market fundamentalism as socialist or socialism. Social Darwinism, term coined in the late 19th century to describe the idea that humans, like animals and plants, compete in a struggle for existence in which natural selection results in “survival of the fittest.” Social Darwinists base their beliefs on theories of evolution developed by British naturalist Charles Darwin. Some social Darwinists argue that governments should not interfere with human competition by attempting to regulate the economy or cure social ills such as poverty. Instead, they advocate a laissez-faire political and economic system that favors competition and self-interest in social and business affairs. Social Darwinists typically deny that they advocate a “law of the jungle.” But most propose arguments that justify imbalances of power between individuals, races, and nations because they consider some people more fit to survive than others. Social Darwinism's philosophical problems are rather daunting, and fatal to it as a basic theory (though some have applied similar ideas). First, it makes the faulty assumption that what is natural is equivalent to what is morally correct. In other words, it falls prey to the belief that just because something takes place in nature, it must be a moral paradigm for humans to follow. This problem in Social Darwinist thinking stems from the fact that the theory falls into the \"naturalistic fallacy\", which consists of trying to derive an ought statement from an is statement. For example, the fact that you stubbed your toe this morning does not logically imply that you ought to have stubbed your toe! The same argument applies to the Social Darwinists' attempt to extend natural processes into human social structures. This is a common problem in philosophy, and it is commonly stated that it is absolutely impossible to derive ought from is (though this is still sometimes disputed); at the very least, it is impossible to do it so simply and directly as the Social Darwinists did. Socialism means the reorganization of economic life under the democratic control of the actual producers, the working people whose labor creates all wealth. It can come about only through the independent political mobilization of the working class, led by a revolutionary party, which establishes a new and far more democratic form of state, a workers' state, which exercises ownership and control over the means of production. Socialism cannot be engineered through backroom deals between Wall Street bankers and Washington politicians, or through the policies of any Democratic or Republican politician. Some 160 years ago, Karl Marx wrote, \"A specter is haunting Europe, the specter of communism.\" He was describing the mood of fear and trepidation in the European ruling classes on the eve of the great revolutionary wave of 1848, even though the number of conscious revolutionary socialists was still a relative handful. If the specter of socialism today haunts the American ruling class, despite decades in which socialism has been subjected to an unrelenting campaign of slander and vilification, it is likewise because the profit system faces a new period of revolutionary upheaval.", 10675, "bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa", -1],
	121872 : ["Republicans in general, no. But there are Far Right people who think less conservative Republicans are \"Rhinos\" (Republicans In Name Only), and view Democrats as either Communists, or their \"Useful Idiots\" who do the bidding of the Communists without realizing the damage they are doing to America.

	121882 : ["I'm afraid there are no shortcuts to becoming a baptised Jehovah's Witness. You have to go through their study books first so you understand all their beliefs. Then you have to answer over 100 questions to prove you agree with their beliefs. That's going to take months of study with them. With regard to their book 'What The Bible Really Teaches' it should be called 'What the New World Translation of the Bible Really Teaches'. This is because their version of the Bible has been changed to fit in with their beliefs, and their beliefs are totally different to Christian beliefs. I was brought up from birth into a strong J.W. family but left that organisation in the 1970's when Armageddon failed to turn up, again. This organisation is obsessed with Armageddon and they use fear to control their members because they say they will be the only people to survive Armageddon. They also say they are the only true Christians and God chose them as His sole channel of communication in 1919. Also, they say Jesus' second presence happened invisibly in 1914. There is nothing in the Bible to substantiate these claims! They control their members by fear of being disfellowshipped if they don't conform and put in time going from door to door and attending meetings. A baptised J.W. who is disfellowshipped (for immoral conduct or speaking out against their beliefs) will be shunned. You do not need them to tell you what to believe. You do not need to study their literature to understand the Bible and you absolutely do not want to read their version of the Bible which has been changed to fit in with their beliefs. I shall be praying for you that God directs you to Christians whose faith is in Christ Jesus, and him resurrected, and not in the J.W. false ficture of a created angel called Michael.", 10680, "None", -6],
	121883 : ["Oh, yes!!! I pay a lot of attention! My home team is the Kane County Cougars. I live only 15-20 minutes from their stadium and I go to around 20 games a year. My sister works there and I will work there next year, so she gets 2 free tickets to every game. I just go with her early a lot of the time, sit outside the park until it opens, and go in and get autographs! And minor leaguers sign a bunch of autographs because there is only  about 3 people there getting autographs and the others don't care because they don't know the players yet. I try to make one game per series, and that's it. But I have gotten to meet and talk to some nice players. They go up to the Oakalnd A's. I spend about 20 minutes a day just looking at the good prospects and how each team is doing. The A's and Rays have got some great players coming up in 5 years. And the Cougars just got Jemille Weeks, the 8th overall pick in the draft, and whose brother is Rickie Weeks. I will get his autograph! And I just got Ryne Sandberg's autograph when he came last week. He is the manager of another team. So that's it! Sorry for carrying on so long! :) Oh, and it's cool to see some of the players that played in Kane County. Dontrelle Willis, Migues Cabrera, and Josh Beckett all played there!

On another note, it'll be interesting to see Masterson's transition to the bull pen goes.

Manny Pacquaio is the eiptome of greatness.  His sportmanlike personality and modest behavior truly captivate many fans to respect him even more.
