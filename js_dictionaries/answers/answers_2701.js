I would try to stay as close to $150 as possible.  Talk to your bridesmaids though and see what range is comfortable for them. Best wishes!!!!!!!!!!! Edited to add:  My friends each picked their own black gown and ranged from $89.00 to $160.00, but the dresses were all their choice and one of them already plans to wear her's again.", 11486, "cdbgWFdTaa", 1],

	140889 : ["\"do they have the right to do that?\" Yes. And, truthfully, you don't even want those 500. Because here's how professional photography works: For every twenty shots you try to get, one is good. You run the high speed, and you shoot like mad. Half of them will have bad focus or lighting. In one, the kid in the front row has a finger up his nose. In one, three people have their eyes shut ... You get the idea. A few are even of the walls and floor, because in the digital age it makes sense to just keep shooting while you move. You take those 500, and (if you're lucky) you spend three days tweaking and cropping to get 100 good shots. Then you show *those* to the client, and s/he picks the desired prints. \"what's the legal stand on this issue?\" The legal stand is that the photographer owns the copyright. Your money buys the service, and the physical manifestations of that service (prints, albums, disc, whatever), not the art. This very common practice. Exactly how it works. And I'm sure you'll be very pleased with the results if you're able to just relax and let the photographer finish his or her job. :)", 11484, "d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa", 2],
	140890 : ["Terms and conditions of any contract or business policies are sound so long as the client has been made aware of such or otherwise should have reasonably been aware. If such T and C were were not provided (direction to read a website may be sufficient) you certainly have an argument. Further, if this is not common practice your position is strengthened. I assume it is normal for the client to chose which photos they wish to use from a collection of proofs rather than the business chose and retouch as they see fit. I would be inclined to push a little harder. EDIT I find the other answers a touch off base. In the first instance this is a legal issue, not a photography issue. The focus here is correctly the contract that has arisen by virtue of you engaging the services of that business. Your expectations are not outside the norm nor are they outside the norm for businesses offering professional studio photography whether that be glamour shots or headshots especially. As I noted earlier, the terms and conditions of the contract are the key. Generally you would find such explicitly expressed but where they are not, common practice should be expected. Common practice would be the client is shown a selection of proofs which have been culled from the total number of photographs taken. Adjustments of shade, contrast or colour would be expected in the offered proofs, retouching would not be. Questions of copyright are not an issue in this matter, at no point are you claiming ownership of the work. Further, copyright is in no way connected with which photographs should be selected from the proofs or whether the photographs should or should not be retouched. You are simply expecting a product consistent with your commonly held expectations and if no explicit contractual provisions state otherwise you should feel confident arguing for such. The legal position rather than the \"Im a wanker photographer\" position is set out in my answer.", 11484, "USbpHhwNaa", -3],
	140891 : ["This photographer is not doing anything illegal or incorrectly.  Now, I don't agree with his practices, but he is completely in the right here.  Under copyright law, the creator or the photograph owns all rights to the photograph.   ***Edit*** All you paid for was the photographer's services and if prints are included, you paid for those prints but not the pictures themselves.  This is why so many people get upset with 1-hour photo places when they bring in photographs done by a professional and try to copy them.  The consumer does not own the photograph only the print, and the person who holds the original pictures (ie negative or RAW file) owns the photograph unless a copyright release has been given to the consumer from the creator.  Said copyright release will state what uses the consumer has rights to with what pictures and usually will describe what the pictures are, how many copies and in what sizes may be made.", 11484, "Nqservvxaa", 0],

	140894 : ["My daughter does the same thing. She falls asleep at the breast and when I put her down she wakes up and screams. I always let her nurse again right away and she falls right back asleep. It will usually happen a few times; nurse,sleep, down, awake- nurse, sleep, down, awake.... sometimes I have to put her down about 4 or 5 times before she actually stays asleep when I put her down. When she does stay asleep though, it's usually for a while, so the extra 20 mins or so it takes to get her down is worth it.", 11480, "NowyO5dBaa", 1],
	140895 : ["When I went to the pediatrician for my son's 2 month check up the doctor asked about my sons sleeping habits. He said if he sleeps more (like 3 or 4 hours) after his bedtime feeding then he is getting enough breast milk. If he doesn't he will wake up more frequently. The past 2 nights he slept through the night. He is a big boy as well (17 lbs 9 oz, 26 3/4\" at his 4 month check up). Believe me it gets better. Also, if she does nurse, try to steer clear of caffeine. Babies take longer to release the caffeine from their bodies. No matter what is going on, consult your pediatrician or more than one. There is nothing wrong with giving them a call. You need sleep and letting your daughter cry herself to sleep is the answer for a 2 year old with sleeping problems, not a 3 month old. She needs comfort and you are her voice. I hope this helps. Take good care of you.", 11480, "oSUYxvaxaa", 0],

Is she asking for more pictures to be edited?  You never actually said that.  Generally if you can give a model 2-4 edited pictures per outfit she poses in, you are in good shape.

At one time they produced a version where each segment was a different colour/flavour but I can't remember what they called it. One of my earliest chocolate memories is of Five Boys chocolate (which I think was first made by Fry's and then by Cadbury's). It was a slab of milk chocolate divided into five segments, each of which bore the embossed face of a little boy. Each face had a different expression ranging from smiling to crying. This subject brings back a wave of childhood nostalgia. Near my first childhood home there was a shopping parade with bubble gum machines outside the sweet shop, You put in your penny, turned a knob and your gobstopper or bubblegum magically dropped into the drawer below. Some of the machines had little plastic toy prizes inside but these proved elusive. In later years, on the way home from school we would call in daily to the large newsagents/sweet shop that occupied a large corner position on the street. They had a huge counter divided into what seemed like a hundred sections, each containing different chocolate bars and packets of sweets. On the wall behind were large jars containing sweets which were sold loose by weight. Another section had many varieties of sweets which were 2, 3 or even 4 for a penny, such as jelly snakes, flying saucers and fruit salad chews. There were also Lucky Bags, Sherbet Fountains, Liquorice Catherine Wheels or \"shoelaces\" or \"pipes\", Barley Sugar sticks, Coltsfoot Twists, Love Hearts, Candy Necklaces and a myriad other goodies. We kids used to stand amid this Aladdin's Cave of sweet delights for what seemed like an hour, deciding how best to spend our tuppence or threepence in order to get the maximum value for it.
