People tend to buy about one \"grade\" above what they can afford. Most light plane owners try to get by as cheap as possible. They find shady A&Ps that will \"pencil\" inspections or ignore problems. They try to DIY tasks that are beyond their skill level. Most of them don't fly enough to stay really current and capable. Next, egos and braggadocio takes over, with often fatal results. The unfortunate result is a safety level about the same as motorcycles.

	21066 : ["The only jets I know of that can hover are some models of the Harrier (I believe the Hawkey Harrier and Harrier II), the F-35 II, and F-35B. They are able to do so because: 1. They have thrust-vectoring engines that can tilt the engine nozzle vertically. 2. Their thrust-to-weight ratio is greater than 1, depending on how loaded the aircraft is (the F-35 models on MTOW (max takeoff weight) can't vertically takeoff). The majority of jet engines aren't capable of thrust-vectoring. Some jet engines are capable of thrust-vectoring but can't tilt the engine nozzles vertically such as the engines on the F-22. Many fighter jets have a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than 1 and are capable of flying vertically but can't hover due to the lack of thrust-vectoring engines. Edit: according to a more recent answer, all Harrier models can do that. I thought only some could. Also, the V-22 and helicopters with turbine engines aren't considered \"jets\". They're propelled by rotors powered by turbine engines, but the engines themselves aren't propelling the aircraft.", 3425, "826q1Fbjaa", 2],

A 30 year old aircraft is considered somewhat old, given that design is typically for a 25 year service life. While ferrying the obese imbecile around, it likely accumulated a lot less cycles than when flying passengers, the fact remains that 757 are being retired (the last model left the factory in 2004) and that the RD211 engine has been out of production since 1997; meaning that parts will be getting scarce.
