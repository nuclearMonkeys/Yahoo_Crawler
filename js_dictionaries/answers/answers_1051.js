It is new years day and no I really see a need to get back to normal but alas, many people are enjoying a 4 day weekend since it will soon be the weekend. At least they are here in America.

I would def be suspicious, but since you were intoxicated I guess you will never know unless one of them decides to fess up. I wouldn't put myself in that situation again to where I didn't know what was going on. Drinking can make wrong things happen between people and it's not worth it. Keep your eyes open in the future and see if they start to show any other signs of being interested in each other. If it did happen maybe it was just a mistake because of too much booze. They may be sorry and ashamed to talk about it. If it was something done on purpose, then you will see other signs of it if you keep watch of their actions.

Â That should be a lesson for the rest of society, including the justice system. â€¨â€¨It's amazing that there is still no seriousness taken to pushing a person who makes a false rape charge that could throw others into jail and ruin their lives forever. The very severity of the outcome for others by someone making a false rape charge has to be the marker for punishment for those that would dare to do so. Instead, false rape charges can be frivolously made precisely because they penalty for doing so is little or nothing. â€¨.â€¨â€¨â€¨â€¨â€¨", 8018, "aSm9xSn3aa", 8],
