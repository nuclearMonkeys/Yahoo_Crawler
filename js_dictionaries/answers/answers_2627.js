It would seem higher wages are in order. I advise your husband to get the training, create the opportunity, and work himself into higher wages. You guys don't have enough money. If you had the whole pie, you don't have enough money. It reads like the family is taking a vow of poverty. There are simply too many people relying on a very small income.. and, since three of them are adults.. I think the State is not the source of the problem. Your husband has two children to support.. he needs to get busy. And bring in a higher income.  My son pays $1,789 per child per month. He feels the pinch too.", 11345, "bjv00RoZaa", 0],

Seems to me like that is what a loving and caring father would be doing.  The state cares about the wellbeing of the children. If he didn't want to dish out his pay check because he couldn't afford it, he shouldn't have had kids. Especially if his income is so low. He's not in the position financially to be providing for children.  Also you fail to bring up the most important factor in this. HES MARRIED TO YOU. Your income actually determines how much he pays in child support, because your income supports him and counts as his income. Usually when the parent paying child support gets married, their support goes up. That is, in most states.  But I think you both only care about the income he's getting and not caring that his children are being raised by a crack whore.  Why is THAT not the issue here? -Connor", 11345, "K4zsztkRaa", 0],

This is a key one - They really don't work (which may be why people over medicate).  Go ahead and report me if you'd like, but honestly the best advice I can give (this is what I always did) is to use Vick's Baby Rub, get a humidifier going in the room your child is sleeping in (will help way more than any medicine you can buy), and then turn on the shower very, very hot and close the bathroom door. Once the bathroom fills up with steam go sit in the bathroom with your little one for about 5 or 10 minutes. Basically when you feel like you don't want to sit in there any longer you've been in there long enough. The combo of the Vicks and the steam will help a lot. If you do this right before bed he/she should clear up well enough to get some good sleep. Especially with the humidifier going in the room all night long.", 11346, "s1zitZMOaa", 2],

IF you must use a spray, use Marshalls time out or off spray..w/e its called. Most ferrets can easily bite through those sprays. (Personal experience) STOP FLICKING HER ON THE NOSE! You could seriously hurt her. WHen she bites scruff her say NO sternly and then blow a puff of air in her face. It worked with my severe biter whos 4-5 years old..if not older..she was an abuse case You could have her sent back to the breeder. If its marshalls they usually have their dispatcher come get it. Not sure on other breeders.  She might just be scared. You if you don't want her to go back to the breeder could just label her special needs and that she needs an experienced owner. How would you feel having someone you barely know (and different people to boot) grabbing you, holding you..maybe squeezing you. I'd bite too. When she does it scruff her say NO and blow into her face. Its not cruel and it works. If not you might have to send her back to the breeder... edit: Not to be mean but this is why petstores need more regulated when it comes to selling ferrets.
