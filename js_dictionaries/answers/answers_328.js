Though, because the door opens into the room, if a kid was inside and a swift kick and door is open. Unless a ton of stuff gets put in front of it from the room.  Then that is deliberate. Never was a trap.    It really looks like a cheap way of making a somewhat insulated door.  I have no idea what the inside stuff is.  It looks like ceiling tile(which is a fibrous sawdust combined with paper and pressed together insulative value is basically none. . without showing a close up of the frame it is hard to see how this fits together.  Otherwise this needs something similar to outside door weatherstrip to seal it. Pictures, pictures, pictures and measurements. You need that and show any one in any hardware type store.  Even a hand-drawn picture of an opening with measurements LxWxHxD and a  better idea of the contour of the casing.  With measurements.  It only takes you with a pencil and tape measure  and some drawing skill to draw this out.  Having too much information NEVER HURT.  Which way the door swings matters. . My closet doors have a regular door knob.  They are held closed by magnets like  . but not the same as the magnets are double stacked. I can't find an image of them but imagine 2 regular magnets a top of each other so DOUBLE THE STRENGTH.  Suitable for 72\" high door. Regular magnets(not Neodymium magnets) rare earth super strong magnets that cost super high price too.  My magnets on my doors have lasted 45 years and still hold as they did the first day.  Magnet goes on the door casing and the metal plate on the door.  You would need 2 because that wood is the type that warps out of shape. I see the base of the door is a 2x4 stop, so the top of the casing has a stop(or groove) .  Look at you bedroom doors and see how the door stops.  there is either a groove or a \"stop strip\" that is the name this painter is giving them, I don't care what they are called, they stop the door from going farther and bending the hinges.   Some don't have anything...relying on the hinge to stop the door which is just cheap as you can see light into the room and the credit card method of opening the door latch is possible.    With the groove or stop strip your credit card would have to fold like a \"L\" which it does not do. You can figure out how to put up weatherstripping to stop cold air from entering the room as it is screwed to the frame as the instructions show.  This is how your entry doors(from the outside) should be also.", 2859, "None", -2],

They provide a service: for x amount a month, you get a home.  Like everything failure to pay what you owe has consequences.  Many landlords rely on rental income to pay the mortgage on that property or they are using it to provide a boost to their own income. Tenants failing to pay rent can reduce landlords to bankruptcy in a worse case scenario. Put yourself in the landlord's position. You have a rental property with a mortgage, as well as your own home with a mortgage. The rent covers the mortgage, as well as providing someone with a home. Tenant decides not to pay rent... But you still have the mortgage took cover... The same happens next month and the next month.... By this time you are seriously struggling.... After six months you are getting into debt and the lender isn't happy.... You eventfully evict the tenant, at more cost to yourself.  Now do you say, I want my money, or do you say poor guy, he has no money, so I'll let it go and it makes me feel good before I offered him a free home for X period of time?", 2846, "None", 2],
