Also, cameras cannot be directed toward windows, on the property or on other property, to possibly 'see inside'. Tenants may install cameras in interior spaces that are shared with others - kitchens, living rooms etc. These may not be directed toward neighbors' windows.  A tenant can install a camera in their bedroom, to catch on film anyone who enters. They cannot install one in the bedroom of any other roommate, and bathrooms are a strict no-no. So you as the landlord cannot put up a camera in the kitchen to catch what goes on in there, but the tenants may.  You can't be involved in it, however. Any sort of 'agreement' with any tenant, that involves you supplying the equipment, or them reporting back to you with their own equipment, could bring a lawsuit for violating the privacy of those not in on the 'agreement'.", 2842, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", 0],
