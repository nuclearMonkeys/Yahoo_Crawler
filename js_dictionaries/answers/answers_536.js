	29800 : ["There's not a legal requirement. It's a social construct that a married couple is a unit and therefore both are to be invited. It's  rude to invite one and not the other.", 4596, "zQ6bd8Z5aa", 2],
	29801 : ["IF they are a couple, you invite both of them. It's RUDE to invite one, but not the other!", 4596, "None", 2],
	29802 : ["This has been an important point of etiquette for hundreds of years. A married couple is a single social unit as evidenced by the convention of \"Mr. & Mrs. Guy Him.\" The are invited to social occasions jointly, sent a single invitation for both of them. Dates, sweethearts were not invited to respectable occasions. Singles attended as singles.  A mere 200 years ago it was a deadly insult to invite a spouse to an event like a wedding as if he/she were single rather issuing a joint invitation for both spouses. By deadly I mean duels to the death were fought over this insult. The implication was the the other spouse and/or the marriage itself were so contemptible as to be beneath the notice of the host issuing such an invitation.  Another point of etiquette is your idea of \"plus one.\" Every guest is to be invited by name. If hosts don't know a spouse's name, they find out. Like call and ask. If hosts wish to include a special friend whom you would see at their wedding, they get that special friend's name and address and send him/her an invitation of his/her own.  So no, it is not incorrect to invite a single as a single. Married or engaged couples are couples. Everyone else is single. The idea that hosts have some sort of obligation to provide seating and refreshment for your emotional support animal is simply wrong.  And who says is Miss Manners. There is no higher authority in this matter. ", 4596, "iz1cNz5Laa", 1],

	29807 : ["She should have said not right now, but maybe in the future instead of saying no. If you haven't been together for more then a few weeks, I would say the same thing.  Winning the lotto shouldn't change the way some one feels about marrying you. ", 4617, "I1x1vy2laa", 0],

	29811 : ["Yes, some antidepressants can lower the libido.  But \"lower\" doesn't mean destroy it completely.  Also, is she getting talk therapy for this depression, or did she just run into a pill doc who hands them out?  Anti depressants can be very helpful, but they aren't a magic pill.  In addition, it's far more common to gain weight on them than lose weight.  I mention all this because something else may be going on.  Obviously, you need to talk to her.  If she's been on them for months, you should be noticing a positive difference.  If you aren't seeing that, my guess is there's something else happening she's not telling you, she's not on the right meds, and/or she does need that talk therapy.  Either way, you need to let her know you're unhappy right now, and then see what the 2 of you come up with.", 4619, "Ohcyim3Kaa", 0],

	29815 : ["What you wear on wedding day is entirely your personal choice. Today, not all brides wear a white wedding dress. Your attire should reflect whatever makes you feel special in the moment  whether it is white ball gown or a red traditional dress. As long as it feels right to you, it is the right thing to wear. You should feel good about yourself on the inside and the outside.", 4603, "h2AMF9Ayaa", 0],
	29816 : ["I absolutely love a dress with a bit of color especially for small weddings. Let the white thing go and not just saying this; but, blush pink is my fav. You will feel bridey. All eyes will be on you and let's face it, not too many people can wear white--makes them look washed out and this way you can wear your normal make up (if you wear) and not have to worry about extra because of the white dress. Wrap a \"symbolic\" hankie or white satin ribbon around handle of your bouquet or use a simple hem stitch and attach a little white bow at hem line underneath the dress. If you are religious carry a small white Bible under your bouquet. You can have it attached in some way or carry with handle of flowers. Let officiant read a passage from it to make it special. Suggestion: 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 Just a suggestion as a retired florist. A total white bouquet has no punch, no pzzzzaz and the white roses are off white. I've never seen a chalk white rose.  I would add a touch of pink alstromeria (florist will know). It is a small flower comes in many different colors and is in the orchid family.  Also you could pin up one side of your hair or front to back with a floral barrette in the pink and white alstromeria.  Also if you like carnations, the mini pale pink are beautiful. I like/just me/ a round/coronet of baby's breath around the the brides hair, looks ethereal.", 4603, "TVHItxGCaa", 0],
