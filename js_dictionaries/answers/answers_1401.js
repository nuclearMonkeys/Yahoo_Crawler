	75693 : ["1) If Jesus existed, where are his writings? Gobs of people who have existed have never written any publicly available document, and nearly every document that has ever been written has NOT been preserved.  We know Jesus was literate, so he must have written at least some things during his education - but there is no reason to believe that he wrote anything after he began his ministry. 2) none are written by the savior himself, or even directly by any of his personal followers (the Testament's were dictated, not written by the 'writers' themselves). What is your evidence supporting this claim?  How do you know, for example, that the gospels of Matthew, Mark and John were not written by those individuals personally?  Certainly people of that time often wrote for themselves (Paul tells us so in many of his letters). 3) nor were his apostles Actually, we only know that a few of the apostles were probably literate - there is no reason to believe that all of them were, and good reason to believe that some of them probably were not. 4) So why is the earliest recording of his existence not until at least thirty years after his listed death? What is the evidence supporting this claim?  Or, to put it another way:  who in the world knows so precisely when it was that the gospels were written? 5) If he was such a big deal why did he not write anything? Because his *work* was such a big deal.  Jesus knew that his time was limited, and that his duty was to preach the gospel to as many of the Jews as possible in that time.  How would his pausing in his preaching work to write further that goal?  Others could write - and clearly they did so.  However, if Jesus had done so, that message would probably NOT have reached the thousands of illiterate Jews that were living and dying during his lifetime.  He did was was most important for him to do.  Later (though there's no telling how much later), when a surfeit of local preachers became available, there was opportunity *and advantage* to write down what was being preached and to send it by \"post\" to those areas that had not yet received the complete gospel.

Please be cautious in drawing conclusions from this information. The numbers are useful only as a general guide to selectivity and not as a predictor of your chances for admission to a particular campus. These figures are preliminary, as of May 26, 2010. Some campuses admitted students after that date, which may affect their statistics. In addition, keep the following in mind:     * Data for several colleges on a campus are grouped together, which masks the differences in the degree of competition for admission among them. Some campuses and colleges admit students directly into individual majors, and the degree of competition among majors may vary widely.     * The data reflect the selection process for fall 2010 applicants. The selection process may vary from year to year; therefore the results may differ significantly.     * GPA is defined as a student's grade point average in the \"a-g\" requirements. The average high school GPA listed for each campus is computed from 10th and 11th grade coursework, including up to eight honors courses.

It's a slow moving slice-of-life series with some gentle comedy added in, more about the characters living their everyday lives than about any kind of real story.  It's basically about a group of 5 girls who are members of the military, one of them a new recruit, stationed in a quiet remote town on the edge of their country. They have some basic military duties, but it's mostly just about their daily lives. Interacting with the townspeople, having dinner together, getting to know more about each other, maturing, etc...It's not very military focused at all, although obviously the military and war are touched on now and then. The series takes place in the far future, but since so much technology has been lost over time, it feels much more like it's set in the past.   There are a few moments that get a little dark (I don't want to get into spoilers, so that's all I'll say), but the series is mostly fluffy and lighthearted. I do enjoy slice-of-life series quite a bit (although I know not everyone does!), and this one is pretty well done, so I'm enjoying it.
