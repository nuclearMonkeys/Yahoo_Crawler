The real problem is that you are not an equal partner in your marriage. You don't say if you are a stay-at-home mom. In my opinion that's a full-time job. But even if you are, it seems that your husband doesn't think that your contribution entitles you to an equal vote.  I was in the same situation while raising our children. We are now divorced. I went back to school and I am applying to a doctoral program because I promised myself that I would never be so dependent again. Get a job, or get a degree then get a job.

	137292 : ["Hi there, I don't live in that area, but I do know there are no support groups by me, either.  I belong to a few different yahoo groups for support, and it really does help.  You might try that.  I broke my tailbone and surgery made me worse, so I belong to a tailbone support group, a pump group as I have a morphine pump implanted and also a chronic pain group. As for methadone, I used to take it.  I quit when they implanted the pump.  I'm sure you'll hear tons of negative, but honestly, I had a very positive experience with it.  I took it for nearly a year.  When I first started, the dosage was ab it too high and I had some urinary hesistancy.  Other than that, the only other side effect I had was constipation, which is typical of opiates.  It controlled my tailbone pain as well as some neuropathic pain I developed down both legs.  I felt the medication was very effective and I definitely recommend trying it as long as your doctor recommends it.  Plus, it's VERY cheap!!!  And it also has a longer half life so you only have to take it 2 or 3 times a day as opposed to every 4-6 hours like most opiates.   I definitely think it's worth trying.  I give it 2 thumbs up :))  I wish you the best of luck!!", 11352, "AA12136637", 0],

	137297 : ["You have got some real issues which surround money here! You did place him in a no win situation by wading in and contacting the relatives however. Think about how difficult it will be for him to side with you without looking weak and ineffectual. He is responding in a defensive manner, and that is understandable with that phone call   What he did was wrong. But what you did compounded the problem.  You might just have to bite the bullet on this one. But, I think you need to sit down and come up with some ground rules on the spending of large sums of money, because if you don't, this is going happen again. Choose to wait and deal with it calmly later. But do have the conversation. Perhaps I am old fashioned, but my take is that in a marriage, both must negotiate the decision on big items. I also think that if he truly feels that this is not how it should be done,(It is his money...only and your opinion doesn't count) perhaps you should be considering going back to work as there is an imbalance of power and he seems to be using it unwisely for the two of you.  Talk about it. You might consider counseling if it comes to an impasse. But the ground rules need clarifying.", 11350, "75NzrTs3aa", 2],
	137298 : ["I'm not really too sure how to advise you here. You apparently talked about the making of purchases of a certain size, but he breached that. Did you ask him why? Your in-laws are having some financial trouble, yet they ask HIM to purchase elaborate and expensive gifts for their kid(s). The fact that they don't approach you means ----(1) They don't think you will understand and/or comply ---- (2) They don't like you and prefer to talk only to him. Now......they ask him to make this large purchase. Either he can easily afford it, or he's struggling like everyone is. If he can easily absorb this cost, then it shouldn't be AS important to you, other than the fact that he did it without your consent. If you both make enough money to absorb this without too much trouble, then your only real basis for protesting is the 'control' aspect of it. Since that's petty, then you should relinquish and just not worry about it. After all....he's a big boy.....goes to work, pays bills, is responsible, loves his family, earns good money, so it is a lesser issue in this case. If he's struggling and agreed to pay for the gift due to some kind of family duress he may not have had the time to discuss it with you before having to commit to it. In that case, you should again, go along with the circumstances and then tell him that in the future this kind of thing needs to be talked over before making the commitment. I know it sounds like I don't see your side of things....I do, you want to feel included and part of the marriage, and not just someone that gets carried along. I'm thinking that since you don't work, he probably feels that if he's the sole bread-winner, and you can afford it, then it's more HIS choice to make and not yours. And...more than likely, his relatives probably see it that way as well, which is why they probably approached him and not you. You don't make money....so you don't count. Your only recourse is to go out and start making your own money. Swallow this whole thing and earn your own money. Keep it separate from his, and then you can do with your money as you see fit. He sounds like a suppressive kind of personality and your in-laws sound like the same kind of toads that walk around with a false sense of self-entitlement.

One of my brothers is 2 years older than me, and the other is 4 years older than me. When I was young (like 5-6), I remember LOVING arts and crafts stuff. My parents would buy me things like art kits that I'd drool over (figuratively speaking) for months. As I got older, around 7-12, I mainly usually asked for video games, because that's what I really liked. My grandparents would buy us clothes, or simply give us money. Last year, I got an iPod (I was 14 then). Since we're older, and we understand the economic situation, my parents, my siblings, and I usually just talk about what we'd like. However, this year, we know that my oldest brother is getting a new desktop computer (he's a sophomore in college, and his laptop's screen went out) and my other brother and I are getting $50. I don't mind this at all, because a) $50 is a lot money for someone who doesn't have any financial responsibilities (ie. me) b) I got an iPod last year, which I suspect cost around $150+, and c) I understand that my oldest brother really needs a computer. The point I'm trying to make is that it probably will get more expensive later on, because older children/adolescents tend to yearn more after technology than simple things such as $5 action figures, but since they're more mature than toddlers, they are able to understand why X might get a more expensive item than Z, or why there aren't as many presents as last year, and so on.", 11350, "None", 5],
