	43110 : ["Actually, racism towards Arabs is called out on in Israel. There is no shortage of Israelis who'll call out racist rhetoric or action towards Arab individuals, and honestly will be far more outspoken about openly condemning it than you may believe. And I'm not just talking self-loathing or far-leftist Israelis who go so far as to fetishize diversity, since there are many examples of unapologetically patriotic Israelis out there as well. I won't deny that there are racist Israelis out there, racism exists in all societies unfortunately... but, it's definitely not allowed to run rampant in Israeli society. Just try to attack a hijabi, Arabic-only speaking woman in any Jewish-majority city... it won't end well from you. One thing I sometimes note is that examples of racist rhetoric people show me to \"convince\" me Israelis are some sort of racist, unsalvageable people are often articles condemning the action FROM Israeli sources or are neutral but littered with Israeli comments disgusted by it. I've even pointed out that they're very pro-Israel sources, too, and not Ha'aretz (which many feel courts anti-Israel patrons, at least with their English edition). It's almost like so many Israelis hold themselves to be better than that... which, is actually true. Your \"no condemnation\" claim is nothing more than bs, which is utterly apparent if you are actually familiar with Israel and Israelis. Still, to explain the racism that does exist against the Arabs: It may have something to do with the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has at times been escalated to full-blown *WAR* and has seen terrorist action take lives from Israelis. At the turn of the century, so many Israelis were afraid of Arab suicide bombers and having the last thing they hear be an Arabic phrase. While a lot of Israelis are better than this, many still displace their feelings against armies and terrorists who were Arab on others who share nothing but an Arabic background.  In addition, you have to remember so many Israelis are, by *some* definitions, are Arab themselves. Actually, in defining Mizrahi Jews as \"Arab Jews\"... you could say that Israeli Jews are MORE Arab than not!!! Mizrahi Jews DON'T define themselves as Arab, and historically never have, but most did live in Arab-majority lands. They saw themselves as a different people but one that lived alongside the other peoples there, akin to how Copts or the Druze function today. And, unfortunately, the grand majority of Jews of the Arab world have left that world behind, with just a small handful of communities remaining. Most left due to the bigotry that they felt there, which in cases could be described or defined as racism itself. It's ironic to some that the \"Arab Jews\" are, statistically speaking, the most likely to discriminate against Arabs... but, in looking at history, particularly recent history where their families have been exiled or even killed, it kinda makes sense to others.  Still ,most Mizrahim don't approve of racism towards Arabs (or anybody, really), but there are huge reasons we can see it come from their communities. Now, to get off of the Arab issue specifically, I should point out that Israelis don't care for being \"politically correct\" because they're blunt: They call it as they see it. Israelis actually do care a lot for people, but they're less concerned about seeming the most morally superior to outsiders. They recognize most of it is held up on flimsy soapboxes. Rather, Israeli prefer to show how good they are through their actions, for example being rather expedient dispatching aid and rescue workers to disasters around the world. They may not always keep their comments to themselves, but they still treat people wonderfully and at least you'll know exactly where you stand with them. As for rejecting racism... Israel has actually done a better job of it than you may realize. Sure, some people hyperfocus on Arab-Israeli issues but we are talking about multiple \"races\" here. Hell, Ashkenazi/Sephardi/Mizrahi were once seen as rather racial subcategories (though these ethnic groups are shown to be rather close) but Israelis no longer care. If we view those as races, then Israeli \"racism\" is failing as the Israelis are so incredibly mixed by those standards: Most kids now are mixtures of multiple backgrounds. Israel has spent globs of money to rescue Jews of all sorts of racial backgrounds, and while things still aren't perfect Israelis aren't shy about discussing these things and have better hope regarding their future. I think that's incredibly civilized.", 6239, "hKgjv1Deaa", 2],

However, just as I dislike and think poorly of a large segment of the US population for their negative and socially harmful beliefs and \"culture\", there are subsets of the \"Arab\" peoples that also disturb me and I perceive as being unacceptable.  In other words, I don't write off all Americans as total jerks because there are lots of total jerk Americans, and I don't write off all Arabs as total jerks because there are a lot of total jerk Arabs.

So we were talking to him… He was, again, deported, and then he came to Rawalpindi – he lives in Rawalpindi-Pakistan. We talked to him, and he told us that when he was in custody, a policeman over there agreed that Israel has asked them to deport all Pakistanis.\" When Faizah tried to reach out to the Foreign Ministry of Pakistan and the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis to ask for help, it seemed she was talking to a wall. \"We were trying to reach out different officials over here, the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, and at that time, all they said all honestly, all they said it's not in our hands, it's an international crackdown, so it's not in our hands.\" \"We think it's happening because of the UAE's very recent acceptance of Israel as a state. And again, when you do that, you have to serve back to that state as well.\" Note: Names have been changed to protect identities. - - -  I am NOT saying everything you read in a Newpaper article, especially the Tehran Times is accurate or truthful. When I went to the internet to find news of this it was VERY HARD! to find. Do a search yourself. The mainstream media only publishes what is convenient to it's agenda! What we can say is Shiites ARE BEING PERSECUCTED by the Sunni regimes that were bought out by Trump or pretending to be Israel's/US's ally to destroy Iran. I think the UAE and Saudi Arabia are conveniently scapegoating Israel to justify their actions as dictators. If protests get out of hand they'll just blame Israel ALL OVER AGAIN!  Please watch \"Saudi Arabia Uncovered\" on Netflix. If you see my latest question I left a YouTube video of the documentary please watch.

If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (The Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbrings them up alevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put these wreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofTheotokosVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints. Crosses on solesofshoesandbackofpants are blasphemy. Demons makecarpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walkoncrosses. Playingcards mockhow Jesus sufferedonthecross: clubs(cross on which Jesus wascrucified), diamonds (fournails Jesus was crucifiedwith), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesuswas given to drink),spades (spear with whichJesus waspierced).Cremationisdevilworship; onlyblasphemers suchasLenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this.

In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same SupremeBeing [aka thedevil].
