	82059 : ["Disney honestly admits that one of the best times to go there is between Thanksgiving and December. It's one of the most peaceful times of year there, as far as crowds go, because it's sandwiched between the two holidays. Compared to the crowds then, it seems dead silent! :P Aside from the crowds, it's also very visually appealing! They usually have some decorations from Thanksgiving left to take down, and   decorations to put up! If you're going the week directly after Thanksgiving, I'm not sure how much of the   part you'll see, but I could be wrong. :  I only say this because you specifically asked about the crowds.  I hate to tear you in both directions, but I do have to mention that the Food & Wine Festival at Epcot ends after Thanksgiving. I've been there for it twice, and if I had to option, I definitely wouldn't miss it! It's not like they're passing out food and wine for free, you have to pay for it, but it's basically a bunch of little stands stationed outside the different countries in World Showcase, and it. Is. Delicious. :P I know the Birnbaum's Official Guides confirm the information about the crowds, they may even have the statistics in there. There's also my insane amount of experience. I've been to Disney World 13 times, the 14th is coming up in a month. I've been there during both of the times you've offered. I personally preferred the week before Thanksgiving because of the Food & Wine Festival and the fact that I had two holidays to look forward to after. If you're more concerned about the crowds, however, I'd have to recommend the week after. You wouldn't believe how drastic the difference is. :P This isn't a make or break situation. Whatever you decide upon can't possibly ruin your entire trip: it's Disney World! :P Have a great trip, best wishes! °o°", 9094, "r9pBulexaa", 0],

First, you must know that everybody suffer from low self-esteem at one time in their lives, so don't get discourage by that. Here are somethings that you can do to build your self-esteem and not being awkwardly quiet. - Make a list about the things you like and would eagerly do with joy. (like a hobby) - Get to know you better alone. (don't focus on how awkward will be some interaction) - Find your sense of humor. (laugh its proven to be the best way chill out things)   It will be more easy to make friends. - Learn to communicate confidence with your body.

Sadly it looks like you are the type of person who is going to continue to have few friends and will probably still deal with low self esteem no matter what i say(or what anybody else does or says for that matter). The only solution is to make friends but you are too shy to do so. We are not too different. My solution was to stop caring about school and about making friends which ironically made my grades and number of friends go up. You could try that but it probably won't work for you. I'm sure if someone got to know you, you would be a great friend. But no one knows you want to be their friend. They are not going to read your story. Instead of trying to just walking up and talking to someone, you should find something in common first. Join a club or just do something outside of school.  People around you don't know you exist so how can they be friends with you. Do something that will get their attention(in a good way) and they might just talk to you. Be creative. STAND OUT. What I'm trying to tell you is to not try to make friends. First improve your self esteem by distracting yourself with anything you like. You'll be so absorbed(hopefully) in what you are doing that you won't think about making friends so much. Hopefully this improves your self esteem which will make you get friends easier. Or you could try my method and just be over confident in situations that do not require it. People notice your confidence and talk to you.", 9092, "DHhlzBIQaa", 0],

This is a communication problem here. She should have told you to do chores if she wanted you to.

You will meet more people that you have something in common with, and a useful way of building your resume and references in the future for a better paying job.

Then one should only see the brighter side of future. I mean one should not look back about the darker side of the shadow. Avoid darker side of viewing things. Be positive in attitude with a noble vision. Besides, one should not entertain unnecessary confusion, doubt or fear in his mind. The mind should not be disturbed or polluted because of impurities. Moreover, he should lead a righteous life or principled life or qualitative life. His thoughts, words and deeds should match with each other. I mean it should be homogeneous.

They feel that if you see how hard it is for them that there is no need to tell you, and that you would just do it, to please her.   Mom's do that a lot and then get angry when you don't do it.   They only get agitated because what they were thinking wasn't even close to reality and then they wonder why you didn't think of it yourself.  Sometimes moms think that their child is a lot like they were when they were your age.  Maybe no one had to tell her and she expected it from you as well.  Well, you are not her.   Maybe moms feel they are working hard for an ungrateful child, one who doesn't care how hard it is for them.    I bet, later on after she yells at you, she tries and make it up to you but you won't hear of it.   That happens a lot of the time.  What you guys have is a communication problem.   Nobodys fault.
