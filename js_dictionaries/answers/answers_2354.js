	123523 : ["Years ago, it was not mandatory to have car insurance when driving a car. It became a requirement to drive a car since damages, and loss of health or life were as a result of irresponsible drivers. Irresponsible drivers then learned through paying for insurance to remain responsible. The roads were very different pre-insurance dates. Even persons without driving records saw an increase in their rates--the demand to have insurance and forced drivers to pay for it, increased the costs since the insurance companies had them over a barrel. The same will happen with health insurance--rates will go up since it is a requirement to purchase the insurance or pay a penalty. Supply vs Demand.

You buy it to protect yourself and not others outside your family.

	123550 : ["I am a Conservative (Libertarian) and I agree with you, but only to a point. They should have protested.  Anyone who is a true conservative, not a neoconservative, should have been upset with the Patriot Act, the expanding power of the executive branch, the war in Iraq, and especially the TARP.  There were a small hand-full of Conservatives who were protesting (most were supporters of Ron Paul).  I was livid about the Patriot Act, the war in Iraq, the first stimulus, and the TARP. And I protested all of them. Republicans are protesting now because it took losing the Congress and the Presidency to see that they had betrayed their principles of small government, free markets, and intelligent foreign policy.  Admitting that they were wrong is no excuse for supporting Bush's agendas. Neo-cons followed their leader straight to hell. I am protesting Obama because there is no way that he can increase the size and spending of the Federal Govt without having to raise taxes in the future. You don't have to be a Conservative to realize that when the deficit gets to $9.3 trillion in 9 years, as the CBO asserts, the government will raise taxes on EVERYONE.  It is impossible to borrow our way out of debt, or spend money we don't have to end a recession, or pass authoritarian laws to promote liberty. You say that Obama is \"actually working to HELP the average American\".  How does creating a 9.3 trillion dollar deficit help the average American?  How does printing money like there is no tomorrow cause anything but inflation?  How does inflation help the middle class, or anyone on a fixed salary, or anyone with savings?  How does government spending create more jobs than it takes from the private sector? I have the feeling that even though I have explained myself, you will not like my answer. Please tell me why. I am all but sure that you are giving Obama support, not because you understand or agree with him, but because you are a Democrat. Democrats do not support war. Democrats do not support the same policies that caused the mess we are in now. Democrats do not support the suppression of liberty. Your question shows that Republicans have been two-faced, and you are correct about that. But Obama is doing many of the same things that Bush did, like escalating wars, increasing the size of the government, increasing the deficit, printing money like crazy, issuing more bailouts, more stimuli, taking away entitlements, failing to show transparency, and using power to promote Fascism. So if you were against Bush, do you hold Obama to the same standard? Why aren't you protesting Obama, if you were protesting Bush? Libertarians have been honest through both administrations. We have not been two-faced, partisan, or unreasonable, so there is no reason to fault us, the true Conservatives. EDIT in Response to added details:  First and foremost, Barack Obama inherited a $1.75 trillion deficit from George Bush. After Obama came up with his budget, the Congressional Budget Office calculated that within 10 years, Obama's budget would lead to a $9.3 trillion dollar deficit. These are facts.  Next, you say that Obama is restoring America's \"moral authority\" in the world. Why was he unable to convince any world leaders to help with his \"Global Stimulus\"? Why is the world still angry that he is escalating wars in the Middle East? What is the definition of \"moral authority\"? Who is Obama an authority to?  We already have health-care for all. Hospitals are not allowed to refuse service to anyone. Why is this so hard to understand? You say it takes money to solve problems. How can you borrow your way out of debt? Please explain this to me. Last, you mention the Fed, and I agree that the Fed is unconstitutional. I hate the Fed because they interfere with the free market by artificially setting interest rates. By the way, if it wasn't for the Federal Reserve, none of Obama's spending could get out of control. The deficit is comes from the Treasury issuing bonds and t-bills to the Fed, who prints money for them in return. It makes absolutely no sense to support Obama and not the Fed, or to criticize the Fed and not Obama. Please wake up.", 10754, "AA11518835", 2],
	123551 : ["Bush didn't raise taxes on ANYONE. He cut taxes across the board. Revenues to the federal government increased and the debt to GDP ratio was lower than the average since WWII and lower than during the Clinton administration. They did spend too much on programs that the federal government shouldn't be running, but then many of the Republicans who were doing the spending were voted out of office.     Iraq is NOT a needless war. The entire intelligence community believed that Hussein was a threat and needed to be taken down. It wasn't \"for no reason other than lies, greed, and oil\", there were, I believe, fifteen points in the Resolution to Use Force in Iraq. WMDs weren't the only reason. I still haven't heard any proof of lies. And, no, the fact that you don't believe Bush doesn't count as proof of lies. The war in Iraq falls under the category of national defense. That goes very much with conservative ideology. It also is true to the constitution and the intention of the framers of the constitution that the federal government's number one function is national defense.    Obama has the luxury of concentrating on Afghanastan now because Iraq is not the threat it was back in 2003. He's cut the rate of income tax on the middle class and poor, but he's raising taxes on the people who would hire them. He has also said he would raise corporate income taxes. I'm sure you love that, but what will happen when he raises the corporate income tax and the company you work for can no longer afford to pay you? What happens when they move overseas to a country that taxes them at a much lower rate than they are paying here? That will really be a tax cut for the poor and middle class because they won't be working and getting paid so they won't be paying ANY taxes.  The very small tax cut enjoyed by the middle class and poor will be swallowed up by higher prices, lower salaries, fewer hours and inflation caused by printing money(without anything to back it) to pay for the stimulus package. You'll have a little more money, but it will not be able to purchase as much.    So you hate \"Big Oil\", but your okay with \"Big Government\"? How do you feel about \"Big Brother\"? At least \"Big Oil\" does something to bring the gas to the pump. What does the \"Big Government\" do? Last year the Big Oil profits came to about $0.10/ gal. Big Government TOOK $0.184/gal at the pump. That's just at the pump! That doesn't include the 35% income tax, the leases for the land and drilling permits. These are the people who are stealing your money. Not Big Oil!  The tea parties are about taxation and lack of representation. CONgress passed a $1.2 trillion stimulus package that was 1100 pages long and was released just hours before the vote which would make it impossible for anyone to read and understand the whole thing. That is NOT proper representation! It is irresponsible AT BEST! They are then going to raise taxes to pay for that? That sounds alot like taxation without representation.", 10754, "e7wD8sUiaa", -1],

	123556 : ["Ok i would like to share some good facts for the first time....but i will also include other facts :D ---The great Scientist Albert Einstein once said about Gandhi : “Generations to come will scarcely believe that such a one as this (Gandhi) walked the earth in flesh and blood.” He also once said,   ” I believe that Gandhi's views were the most enlightened of all the political men in our time. We should strive to do things in his spirit: not to use violence in fighting for our cause, but by non-participation in anything you believe is evil.” ---Gandhi, a practitioner of non-violence and truth, advocated that others follow the principles. He lived modestly and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn he had hand spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as means of both self-purification and social protest.  Mahatma Gandhi experimented with diets to see how cheaply he could live and remain healthy. He started living principally on fruit and goats' milk and olive oil. ---During the freedom struggle, he wore nothing but a loin cloth. ---At the age of 36, whilst married, Gandhi decided to become celibate in order to achieve a state of enlightenment . As he got older, he became more and more fascinated with sex to the point that, second only to non-violence, it was the subject he most talked about. In order to “perfect” his celibate state, Gandhi would sleep naked with young naked women. One of the women was the 16 year old wife of his grand-nephew Kanu Gandhi. When he wanted to share his bed with his 19 year old grandniece Manu Gandhi, he wrote to her father and told him that they were sharing a bed so that he could “correct her sleeping posture”. When his stenographer R. P. Parasuram found him sleeping naked with Manu, he resigned in disgust.Now this will make you angry :P ---Gandhi was also a prolific writer. For decades he edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, Hindi and English, Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly. He also wrote a few books including his autobiography, An Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth. ---When Gandhi was a student he was asked by his teacher to copy a word from the co student's book during a test.  It happened in the presence of Inspector of schools.  But Gandhi was ready to take the punishment for not knowing the word rather than copying it.  This incident inspires every one of us to be honest in our deeds.The word was \"kettle.\" Gandhi's friends were able to spell the word properly, but Gandhi didn't know how. [The inspector began going around to check each student's paper. While the inspector moved from student to student, the teacher saw that Gandhi's spelling was wrong, so he touched Gandhi's leg with his foot to get his attention. With his eyes he urged Gandhi to look at someone else's paper. But Gandhi didn't want to copy from anyone. When the inspector came to Gandhi, he said, \"Here's a mistake. This boy doesn't know how to spell 'kettle.' He has written it 'ketle'.\" The inspector wasn't angry, but he was disappointed that Gandhi didn't know the answer. The teacher was very angry with Gandhi. I told you to look at your friend's paper, but you wouldn't listen to me. You're a disgrace to my class.\" Gandhi said, \"I may be a disgrace, but I can't tell a lie.\" Gandhi was sorry he'd made a mistake and had displeased his teacher, but he had pleased himself by being honest. The teacher was silent.] ---He was not born a courageous, outspoken leader. In fact, in his autobiography, he says that, as a boy, he was so shy that he would run home from school because he could not bear to talk to anybody. ---He was a walking enthusiast. Walking, he said, “is justly called the prince of exercises\". He began enjoying long walks in high school, preferring lengthy rambles to organized sports. As a law student in London, he saved money by walking as many as eight to ten miles a day. It was primarily those long walks, he said, that “kept me practically free from illness throughout my stay in England and gave me a fairly strong body\". All those years of walking served him well during the Salt March of 1930 when, at the age of 60, he walked 241 miles from his ashram to the sea at Dandi.  ---Once during a train journey a British asked Gandhi to get out of the train as he was considered as a ‘black'.  But Gandhi refused as he had the ticket with him.  The British and the Railway officer cruelly pushed Gandhi out of the train.  This is a sample of Gandhi's bitter experiences with British. ---Gandhi first employed non-violent civil disobedience in South Africa, in the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. ---While in England in 1931, Gandhi made his first radio broadcast for the United States. The first thing the people of the United States heard the Mahatma say was, “Do I have to speak into  this thing?” ---Gandhi was basically very helping and concerned about others. Once while he was boarding train one of his shoes slipped and fell on to the track. He instantly removed the other shoe and threw it near the first one. His intention was to help the person who would find the pair and help himself. ---His life aims were truth, non-violence, spiritualism, religiousness, honesty, discipline, loyalty, aspiration and so on. All these excellent high qualities made him the Mahatma which means a great soul. ---Gandhi was extremely punctual. One of his very few possessions was a dollar watch. Just before he was assassinated, on January 30, 1948, Gandhi was upset because he was ten minutes late getting to a regular prayer meeting. ---Gandhi's thought process and mode of work has inspired millions of people across the world including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. ---Time Magazine, the famous U.S. publication, named Mahatma Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930.  ---As Mahatma Gandhi stuck to peace and non-violence through out his life, he was selected for the Noble Prize in 1948.  But it was not successful as Gandhi was assassinated on the 30th of January, 1948.", 10750, "NzmekUKTaa", 8],
