These are people who own yachts, know the movers and shakers in the Rich Elite Society. They drive Luxury cars and have tailor made suits, go skiing in the Alps and Aspen. Do your research on the TYPE of students who attend. If you were to be accepted, you would not have any peers and you would not, fit in. You aren't on the same socio-economic ladder.

There are more than six billion reasons why the US does not hand out green cards on demand to anyone who fills out the paperwork and pays the fees.  You and your mom aren't the only ones in the world who want to come to the US for a better life. How did you manage to get a EAD?  Are you on TPS?  In any case, if you're interested in attending an Ivy League school, then you can apply as an international student, and once you get your acceptance letter and I-20 document, you can return to your home country and apply to return with a F-1 student visa.  Private colleges and universities get no tax subsidies, so you won't pay higher tuition and will be eligible for most college-funded scholarships and other aid.

Unfortunately, until the day all of us as taxpayers unify and refuse to pay our income taxes until the system is changed, they've got us.  Divide and conquer. Don't buy the tax warrior nonsense.  Whether or not the tax protester arguments are valid, nobody and I mean NOBODY has won a case with it.  It's the golden rule...he who has the gold, makes the rules.  I'm not sure what happens if you never file, but you have an SS #, they can find you.  And they will.  Yes, they could send an IRS agent to investigate.  Most likely they're waiting for all those penalties to accrue, and after it's up to a sizable amount they'll come for you.  I'm not sure how they'd tabulate any such penalties since you've never filed..and obviously no 1099s are going out as you're self-employed.  So likely they'll send an investigator out to you who will start questioning your business licenses, etc, will make your life a living hell.  They have many tools in their arsenal, from cleaning out your bank accounts to issuing federal liens on your property.  I think you really, really need to talk to a tax attorney, pronto.   They will definitely come after you for those student loans, which you are absolutely obligated to pay on.  I can understand finagling the income tax, but the student loans --- c'mon now. \"Hope you enjoy Alpo, since that is likely to be your retirement survival option.\" That's likely to be your option WITH social security as well.

That's how. The modern Federal income tax dates to 1913 (the current tax code as amended dates from 1954) but Federal income taxes date back to 1861. Your knowledge of the Constitution is appalling!  Please state where in the Constitution that only corporate profits are subject to taxation.  (You'll be looking forever since no such wordage appears in the Constitution.) You are spewing typical \"Tax Protester\" rubbish.  Nobody has EVER succeeded in raising such a defense on the civil liability to pay taxes.  While a few have managed to dodge CRIMINAL prosecution, in the end they paid the tax; and most of them paid 10 to 20 times more than what the tax would have been originally had it been paid on time once penalties, interest, and legal bills were added on.

	90936 : ["My answer remains the same from yesterday except to say that I don't agree with them treating you coldly now and not speaking to you.  If you got spanked then you paid for what you did and that should have been the end of it.  I know you don't think you deserved it, but you did.  You told off and cussed out your brother in his own house.  Again, I don't think she should have been the one to do it, but something tells me it was probably a little less uncomfortable to have another woman doing that than to have your brother do it, especially given the way it was done. Nobody likes to be spanked, especially not at that age.  It's painful and embarrassing (I know, I've been there), but it's not the end of the world.  You have a sore butt for a few hours and hurt pride for a day or two, but you had to realize that what you did was completely unacceptable.  I mean do you really think it's ok to tell your brother to go f--- off in his own house?  I mean you're eventually going to get the answer you want to hear on here one way or another, but I really hope that at least when you get older you'll understand. I know I didn't until I was older. Seriously, why don't you just apologize to them and ask for their forgiveness?  I mean they were probably wrong in some of the things they said to you, but trying to stonewall them into apologizing to you is just immature.  The adult thing to do is admit you were wrong and promise not to do it again.  There's a good chance they'll do the same, and if they don't, then you were the bigger person in this particular situation, and they're being jerks about it and you should at least feel secure in yourself that you did the right thing in the end.", 9372, "WLRz3IMsaa", 4],
	90937 : ["I'm a 23yr old step mom of an almost 14yr old, 5yr old, & mom to a 4yr old & 19 month old. I raise my step daughter & homeschool her, I probably would beat her butt if she did that but again I am her primary care giver. If you were my daughter, yes, I would have spanked your butt so you did deserve the spanking, although at your age I don't really think it does much good. I however would be pissed if my son (I don't have a son so this is hypothetical) let his girlfriend lay a finger on my child. If it was an aunt or grandmother or something like that it would be different but they shouldn't have let you go to start with so that is really partially their fault ( I know kids lie at that age, me & my husband both did so we know that our children probably would too & unless we checked out what was going on & who was going to be there from another trusted adult my kid wouldn't be going) anyway, they should have put you on lockdown, not let you go anywhere & then should have called your parents & let them decide what was a reasonable punishment for your actions. If I were your parent I would have grounded you for probably 2 months & have put you on a serious probation after that. I think we can both honestly agree that you deserve some punishment but your brother & his girlfriend are probably more at fault here than anyone. Update: I'm not saying that you or friends are bad kids at all but what I am saying is that you are still too young to be let just out without checking out who is going to be there. I know that most kids that age drink & do stupid things, I was 15 yrs old 8yrs ago, I can remember. What I am saying is that what you did was wrong & you deserve some kind of punishment. I expect that my 13yr old SD will do something that is pretty dumb in the next few years, I'm realistic about that & when she does, I will punish her because she has to learn there are consequences to her actions, The word discipline comes from the word disciple, which means \"to teach\" & it is our job as parents to teach you. We expect you to make some mistakes & we are there to correct you & teach you the right way. My 13yr old has lied to me, tried to con me, & I don't what else but all in all she is still a good kid, she's respectful, polite, & helps me around the house but she's a teenager. My four year old will hit her sister sometimes, so I punish her too but she's still a good kid. Like I said I think that your brother & his fiancee are really the ones at the most fault here. They should have known better & they should have called your parents instead of taking corporal punishment into their own hands. I said I would whip my step daughter & I would want to but truthfully I probably wouldn't because I don't think it's effective at your age, I think a loss of privilges is probably a better way to go. I'm not saying that you are not at fault, you still knew better & what you did was wrong & you deserve some kind of punishment but your brother & girlfirend did not act responsibly at all by letting you go & spanking you.", 9372, "None", 1],

The main concern with be having money for tuition fees, but I don't know whether you have chances at scholarships. Odds are that you would have to pay out-of-state tuition fees anyway.  Your only way to adjust status without leaving the US is getting married. Fraudulent marriage isn't that easy, you have to stay married for two years to really benefit, and if you ever get found out you can lose your greencard. Fines and prison service can also be a consequence of getting found out.

	90952 : ["Please stop eating the tax protester tripe.  It will only get you in trouble. If you work at a traditional job, you are already paying taxes whether you like it or not.  Not filing a return only costs you since the vast majority of taxpayers are entitled to a refund of the excess tax that has already been withheld.  If you are opposed to the government keeping more of your money than the law allows, you're a FOOL for letting them keep the excess.  It's your dime and you're free to spend it any way that you choose, but personally I'd rather keep MY dimes in MY pocket, not donate them to the government. Moving to a foreign country isn't going to help you.  US citizens are subject to US tax law regardless of where they live.  You could relinquish your citizenship  but the IRS can continue to collect US taxes for up to 10 years afterward depending upon the circumstances.  Most developed countries have higher taxes than the US does, so you'll only shoot yourself in the foot with that ploy.  Don't forget that the IRS can also sue you in foreign courts for unpaid taxes and they often win those cases. You also need to keep in mind that the SSA will only credit your earnings record for 3 years.  After that point, even if the IRS collects the taxes that you owed (and they usually do) you don't get the earnings credit for SS benefits.  Hope you enjoy Alpo, since that is likely to be your retirement survival option. Your rant on student loans is meaningless gibberish.  I won't waste any more keystrokes on that. You've received direct benefit of your US citizenship, including taxpayer subsidized student loans.

Leeches like you are the type that the IRS loves to prosecute.  Enjoy your stay at \"Club Fed.\" BTW, Ron Paul never said that the income tax was illegal.
