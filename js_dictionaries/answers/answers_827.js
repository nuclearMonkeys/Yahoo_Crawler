Argi-businesses raise animals in a crowded and inhumane way, which is why I spend MORE money buying LESS meat from small farmers who raise their animals in a humane way.. The way to support humane treatment of animals is to shun the big-business meat and eggs, and support local farmers by buying from them.   Just refusing to eat these agri-business products does not help reduce inhumane treatment of animals ... all it does is create an artificial pride about ourselves. If you REALLY care about animals, you support your local humane farmers  (and yes, you can go out and SEE for yourself how the animals are raised)  (and no, I am not a farmer .. there have been no farmers in my family, even my extended family or married family, since 1910).

	45954 : ["Veganism has always been around, but like anything, it has made an appearace into the mainstream lately as the new be-all and end-all, and there are those who feel the need to drive it down everyone's throat. But~~ if you think about it, most anything that is new and controvertial will always have a period of time where people are at lagerheads with each other regarding it. Look at the recent American election, and how that divided people. I mean really? Deaths?? Once the smoke settled from that, and the crazies were carted off, most people with common sense will see that their neighbor is still their neighbor, they may have different views, but   cards will still be exchanged and bbqs will still be held in the back yard in summer. Having said that, the militant vegans need to be carted off. I mean, really~ I am very close to being a vegan, there are some foods that I won't give up because I love them too much, but at least no animal dies now because of me. Keep in mind that I do understand that even eating dairy still maintains factory farms where animals are not kept in humane conditions, I understand that, but I am working on finding substitutes for the few things I still eat with dairy in them, and then I will be vegan. I will never be on a soap box telling you or anyone else you are murderers, I will never drive my lifestyle down your throat, if you ask me why I chose this, I will tell you, but you are the one that has to make up your mind regarding your life choices, not me, and me hammering at you like a crazed maniac is never going to prove anything to you, other than I am a complete vegan militant idiot. I can only take care of my little corner of the earth, and hope that I am doing the best I can, and that is all I expect from anyone else.

	45985 : ["The tricky thing here is that you have a HABIT of eating fast food that you need to break as well as your body being CONDITIONED to eat fast food. Habits are a default behavior that is formed by repetition.  Habits can be changed by CHOOSING the behavior you want and then FORCING yourself to perform the new behavior instead of the habit for a period of time until the new, chosen behavior becomes the habit.  Once your new behavior becomes the habit you may still have to resist the old habit but it will get much easier.  Changing habits probably takes 10-12 weeks to start to feel it become the new habit and then gradually over months the new habit will settle in. The thing about being CONDITIONED to eat fast food is similar.  Your body will literally crave what you have been feeding it.  So if you are feeding it fast food you will crave fast food.  If you start to feed your body healthier food EVENTUALLY you will start to crave that healthier food.  This is very similar to the whole changing of habits thing above but not quite the same. When you are trying to change habits OR eating patterns it is important to substitute another behavior or food rather than just trying to resist doing the old thing. There isn't really a magic bullet for this and to go into healthy foods and how to eat ...would take a book. I have some fairly simple rules about food: The closer to it's natural state the better.  With this rule an apple is better than apple sauce which is better than apple pie.  A steak is better than a hamburger which is better than hamburger helper.  A baked potato is better than french fries which are better than Pringles. I read ingredient labels.  Anything that has more than a few basic ingredients, I don't eat.  Anything with ingredient that I don't know what they are or ingredients that I cannot pronounce, I don't eat it.  Anything that has trans fats or hydrogenated oil it in, I don't eat it.  Anything with high fructose corn syrup, I don't eat it. I try to eat leaner protiens.   I try to eat fresh vegetables every day. I try to eat plain fruit. I do not eat white flour (bleached or unbleached flour) or anything that is made with it. I do not eat white rice. I try to not drink calories.  This includes sodas and even fruit juice. If I am going to drink fruit juice it will be a good, fresh one with no added sugar, I drink it by itself, not as a beverage with a meal, I sip it slowly and really focus on enjoying  the sweetness of the fruit juice. I find that when I eat a healthy meal my body feels good.  I literally have good physical feelings that rush through me.  If I eat an unhealthy meal or eat too much I will feel weighed down and gross. Once you eat healthy food for a while that is what you will start to crave. There is a new sort of idea about food and dieting I've read a little about recently, it is about ADDING good stuff, then the bad stuff eventually falls by the wayside.  So start eating an apple every day.  Add fresh fruits and veges and you'll actually have less room on your plate and in your stomach for bad stuff. I also suggest you pick up a good book on consumer nutrition.  One that has nutritional tables of food it in.  I got one of these in a consumer nutrition class I took over 40 years ago and still have it and still occasionally look stuff up.  It's not just all about calorries and fats and sugars but also about specific nutrients.  I learned that I can get what my body needs to be healthy from food rather than from supplements. I also suggest that you learn about protien, fat and carbohydrate, what they do for your body.  You need ALL of them including fat.  It is important that the fat come from healthy sources like dairy and clean animal flesh, nuts and seeds rather than refined oils.  In my opinion butter has a bad rap.  My skin has never been so beautiful as it got when I added eggs cooked in butter and buttered whole grain toast to my morning routine. I love to cook, I love to eat, I eat pretty healthy and I eat DELICIOUS food, mostly home cooked.  Eating healthy to me isn't a hardship at all and when I do eat something less healthy, like a burger and fries, I feel how gross it is for my body.", 6574, "09c8f2aa42f6255f80371d12edbfa7f6aa", 1],
