	130469 : ["First of all, if you don't want the responsibility of these kids in your pool, I would NOT have them there.  They can end up inviting friends and next thing you know, when you and your family go to use YOUR pool, you can't because there will be a MOB of kids there!  Friends of friends, and tons of kids, all who will see YOU told them they could.  Next make sure for insurance and safety reasons you have a fence with a lock around the pool so no one including pets can get into this pool and drown accidentally.  Including younger kids who may just want to see what it's like.  Your house insurance should have it mandatory an so should your town that you have a fenced in locked area for the saftey of the area and for your own peace of mind.  I would think long and hard before agreeing to let these kids in your pool any time they want.  Do you want them in there, whenever they please?  When you're not home?  When you and your wife and kids want some quiet family time and can't have it because YOU told them in an e-mail that they could come whenever they wanted?   They have NO right showing up at your door that way. You have a right to do whatever you want in your yard and get whatever you want for you and your family without having to have a ton of kids there to baby-sit them!  You're also going to have to feed these kids, give them drinks when they're thirsty, and then IF and ONLY IF they tell you when they have to use the bathroom they will be in and out of your house or peeing in the pool itself.   I know you're close knit, but that's more of a reason why the parents should have more respect for your space and call you and talk to you about it before sending their kids to your door, that's just wrong!  They should have talked to you first and not let their kids do that and I'm sure they knew their kids did it, and it's wrong of them.  They need to respect that you want to spend time with your family in the pool and may have plans and could've had functions going on when the kids showed up and it was wrong.  If you're all close you should be able to talk to them about this.  This is a decision that you should sit down with your wife and talk long and hard about. Do you want these kids coming and going as they please?  When you have company and dinner parties?  When you want some quiet time?  Do you want to buy extra food and drinks for them?  Do you just want the responsibiliy if someone should get hurt, I'm sure if the parents send them over they are going to expect that YOU are watching them.   Do you want these going in and out of your yard and pool as they please?  You're sitting down for dinner and there out your window are kids coming and going through your yard. I would say that you are willing to have some pool parties over the summer and that there are some days when you and your wife are home that you will welcome the kids over with some RULES, but you will let them know in advance when those days are.  You're sorry it can't be everyday but you will let them know when they can come over and what  are expected of when they do come over.  For us, our pool rules were always: NO pushing each other into the water Keep hands to yourself! NO rough housing in the water or around the pool! No Jumping in the shallow ends No peeing in the pool, let someone know when you have to go! No eating around the pool  NO drinks in the pool NO food in the pool Life jackets must be worn (depending on age, if they can swim, etc) NO running around the pool area (someone can fall and get hurt) NO hanging on the ladder Use the ladder ONLY to get in and out of the pool NO jumping on and off the pool toys NO pushing anyone under water! Always let someone know when you are here! Always let someone know if you're not feeling well! NO one enters the pool area without an adult present! It's sad you have to be this way but you don't want to be taken advantage of either and you don't want anyone getting hurt.  If this was your child.  Good luck.  It's hard because these are your neighbors and if you're friends with them it can be hard, but at the same time if they're your real friends, they WILL understand!  You bought this pool for you and YOUR family, NOT for the community! You have a right to enjoy it with your family and don't owe anyone in the neighborhood anything.  You can just narrow down the pool use to pool parties with the neighbors or certain days when you know you're not doing anything and feel like having the kids there.  You know you're going to be the ones babysitting, so you have to make sure you're up for that and if you're not, you're not.  There's going to be times when you're going to want to be in the pool with you and your wife and you can't be made to feel guilty about that, and if they don't understand they're not real friends.  Good luck and I hope all goes well for you!", 11066, "None", 2],

Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is One Lord (Deuteronomy 6:4). Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? Ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? Yea, there is no God: I know not any..  Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from thy womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things, that stretch forth the heavens alone, that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself (Isaiah 44:8 & 24) I am the Lord and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me. That they may know from the rising of the sun, and the west that there is none beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else...(Isaiah 45:5-6) Ye are my witnesses saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he, before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I am the Lord, and beside me there is no savior. (Isaiah 43:10-11) For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called wonderful, counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6) Behold a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. (Matthew 1:23) In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. (John 1:1 & 14) And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God.  (John 17:3) And Thomas answered and said unto him, \"My Lord and my God.\"  (John 20:28) For there is one God, and mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. (1st Timothy 2:5) I and my father are one. (John 10:30) I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. They understood not that he spake to them of the father. (John 8:24 & 27) For there are three that bare record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one. (1 John 5:7) It is not just a couple of verses that declare the Oneness of the Godhead, but the whole Bible. There is but one God, not two, not three, not four, but one God and his name is Jesus.  For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. (Colossians 2:9)  This states the fullness of the Godhead bodily is in Jesus, not that Jesus is in the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

	130494 : ["Your understanding of fasting is limited, and some of the answers are downright wrong; fasting, certainly in the purely faith sense is abstinence from something that would feed and exalt the flesh above the spirit; this could be food, drink, certain types of food or drink, activities that the flesh craves, such as, in the modern world, TV, internet, dancing, nightclubs, literally anything that exalts the flesh and it's lusts over the spirit; in Christianity, as in Judaism, we know that fleshly and worldly lusts and cravings are \"strongholds\" against us, and that the best way to break down and destroy strongholds of the flesh is to deny the flesh, and exalt the spirit in us; the best way is to fast; we would first ask God if we are to fast, then what we are to fast, then for how long; only the Father knows this, and we are to be wholly dependant on Him. In this regard, when we are fasting, we replace what we would normally have with prayer, for the duration of the fast; this is why so many miss the point of the Christian period of Lent, which many use as an excuse to diet! They fail to pray. There is, of course, a benefit to the body with fasting, but this is because you put the spirit in charge, and the more spiritually alive and aware you are, the less the flesh can tempt you, and therefore, the easier it is to make the right choices, so your entire self benefits ultimately.

	130500 : ["It depends on what kind of tone you're going for. Sure, you can start every story with a description or with dialogue, but you run the risk of creating just another story. First, figure out which category your story falls into: Romance, Humor, Anecdote, Horror/Thriller, Action/Adventure, Drama, Tragedy, Mystery/Crime, Memoir, Parody/Satire, Fable/Fairy Tale. From here, you can tailor your opening to fit your story better. Romance (serious stories; if you are making fun of pre-teen crushes, for example, see Parody/Satire or Humor) --Probably the best way to start this would be to describe the person your main character (MC) is in love with through the MC's eyes, possibly contrasting with reality. (ie: \"I've searched far and wide, only to realize Jamie has the most crystal-clear, ocean-blue eyes in the world.\") --Alternately, you could start with a fantasy - a wedding, a kiss, ect - and then come back to reality. Humor (could cover almost any topic, as long as the main goal is to make people laugh) -- Hyperbole (figurative language in which something is drastically overstated) - \"Living with Michael, I had the pleasure of dying every day.\" -- Understatment (figurative language in which something is obviously toned down) - \"When she pushed me out of the 12th story window, I suspected today was not going to be my day.\" -- Basically anything that is out of the ordinary, whether in dialogue, action, or narrative. Anecdote (a simple, brief story, or collection of them) -- This is the simplest type of story, so keep the opening simple as well: establish the setting in one sentence, hint at the purpose of the anecdote, or skip the narrative and explain things in a conversation. Just keep it short. Horror/Thriller -- This is usually the most appropriate case to describe the setting or start with action, rather than using dialogue or a factual statement. Avoid cliches (dark and stormy night, ect), but make it suspenseful. Sometimes it's as simple as rewording the description of a normal setting - you don't have to make it supernatural. And use refrences to death and monsters sparingly, or risk sounding overly dramatic. Action/Adventure -- In these stories, especially, it is important to get to the point right away. Either start in the middle of the action, then flashback/use dialogue to explain the situation, or start with dialogue and bring in some kind of excitement no later than the second paragraph. Drama (like Romance, this is for serious stories) -- Start with a conversation. Characters are going to drive drama stories, so make sure you introduce them right away (and don't describe them too much, especially in short stories; actions and demonstration of personality are more important than flat out description). -- Start by describing the situation (not necessarily the setting). For example, if you are writing about a girl's first day in a new school, describe her uncertainty, the sense of being lost in a crowd; we know what school looks like, so don't waste time telling us that she's standing in a room with beige carpet, 27 desks, 3 windows, a globe, 5 dictionaries, a TV in one corner...only include these details if they play a central role in the story. Tragedy -- One approach is to let your readers know right away that this is a sad story: start at the end (a pastor speaking at the cemetery, the narrater getting dressed for his girlfriend's funeral...). Depending on the point-of-view you choose, you can give the reader insight the characters don't have (\"If I had known, I wouldn't have left her side for a second. I would have taken her to the beach, made dinner for her, stayed up all night talking. But I didn't know, so on my sister's last day alive, I ditched her to play video games with my friends.\") -- The other approach would be to end with a cruel twist. In this case, you'd probably write the first part of the story as if it were another type, using (for example) the beginning from a typical romance story, then only make it a tragedy at the climax. Mystery/Crime -- First option: start at the end. Give a brief glimpse of the perp's shocked face when the handcuffs are slapped on; the cops talking about they're regrets, or relief; the victim's family recieving the news. (See \"Anecdote\", since this section will be short and to the point.) Then go back and tell your story. -- Second option: start with the crime. Show us the crime actually happening (start similar to either Horror/Thriller or Action/Adventure), then launch into the investigation. -- Third option: follow the detective/cops. You might want to start with exactly what the MC experiences. In this, you can either start with him/her on the way to the crime scene, setting up his/her character by giving a reaction to yet another crime. Or, you could start by describing the crime scene itself. If you want the reader to be focused more on the mystery of it than on the story the character has to tell, this may be your best option. -- Fourth option: start before the crime. You should do this if your focus is on the victim. You've seen crime shows, I'm sure; Without a Trace, CSI, Cold Case...they all start with the victim, giving you a taste of charcter and the last time anyone but the killer/kidnapper/ect saw him/her. Again, this would be like and anecdote within your story, so start simple. Memoir (whether fiction or non-fiction, the narrator is recalling a event from his/her own past) -- You could start the same way as almost any other story type, if that's the feel you want. -- Start with the narrator's reaction. It could be the lesson he/she learned, his/her feelings that day, his/her perception and how it differs now... This kind of story can be very conversational, if you want, so it's okay to start by explaining why you are writing (or why the character is sharing this story). Of course, be careful not to write something boring. If you are going to explain your purpose, do so in 1 or 2 sentences, and don't say everything. Leave it vague enough (or emotionally charged enough) that your reader can't help but continue. (\"I was only seven when I discovered my neighbor was not the grumpy witch she pretended to be.\" or \"Regret is a dangerous thing. I should know; it almost killed me once.\") Parody/Satire (making fun of something/someone) -- Like humor, hyperboles and understatements work well here, but if you might have to add a few things. If your parody/satire is linked to someone/thing directly, indicate that right away. (Don't be blunt about it, but if you can tie in a distinctive characteristic of your subject, do so. Your intelligent readers will pick up on it and you can take them to the double meaning of your story right away.) If you want to make a point, bring up the subject in the first paragraph (you don't necessarily have to make your point - sometimes you will be \"arguing\" the opposite side, but in such a way that it seems stupid.) Fable/Fairy Tale (simple, short stories purely to teach a lesson) -- You won't be writing these often, but in the rare case you do, it's the only time you should use cliche openings - \"Once upon a time...\" \"There once was...\" If you use these openings, however, know that they tell your readers, hey this is a simplistic kid's book. It'll waste a few minutes of your time, but don't look for deeper meaning. Or, it will tell parents - hey, this is a children's bedtime story! You don't have to worry about confusing your three-year-old with twenty subplots and a twist every other page! So if you're writing for kids, go this way. Otherwise... -- Do the unexpected. If you're rewriting a fairy tale for an older/modern audience, don't let them know right away. Start with a minor character, or with an even not in the original fairy tale. Set up the new scenario, and THEN let the readers in on the secret: \"That story you knew? Yeah, forget it. Does this LOOK like that story? Cause it is.\" So I think that about covers it. Most of all, write something interesting. In a short story, you've got 1-2 paragraphs to hook your reader. If you REALLY want them to read, the first sentence or two should be something they wouldn't be able to stop thinking about. The best thing you can do for your story is give it an opening line that prompts one of the following responses: \"Huh?\" \"Whoah...\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Hmm...*with a raised eyebrow*\" *laughter*...

It was pretty much along the lines of \"What?\" How could a country with deplorable human rights (or lack thereof) be awarded such a prestigious honour. Don't tell me it was politically motivated, recognizing China as a very serious and real superpower. Fast forward to the torch relay, and the Tibet issue. Does this not add fuel to the fire? It was bad enough China even got the Olympics over Toronto and now the proverbial s**t has hit the fan. Should there be a boycott? No. The athletes deserve to be at the Olympics no matter where they are. In this case the bulls-eye is squarely on the Chinese Government and their Communist rule. So therefore the world leaders should boycott the opening ceremonies, especially those who are part of the G7 nations. Shame on the IOC for giving the Olympics to China. That in itself was possibly the seed that started the rough start the Games. The Tibet protests are simply fanning the fire. It is very unfortunate that the protests have gotten out of hand. There are other ways to voice a passionate protest, so leave the torch runners alone. It is a honour to carry the torch and to be mobbed in a chance of a lifetime, shame on the \"fanatical\" protestors. It certainly doesn't help the cause, and those in China as we all know would never see it anyway. I only hope that the Chinese government will open their eyes and see that the whole world is seeing what is going on and until there is peace will continue to sympathize with the Tibetians.
