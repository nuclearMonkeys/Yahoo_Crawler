This man can usually (but not always, of course) be summed up in the following way:  he is not likely to have completed much formal education, at most his job is a semi-skilled professional, he has low self-esteem and takes rejection exceedingly personally, he lives in a world of romanticized past loves and imagined triumphs, and many times has family issues involving his mother (sounds cliche', but true).

	76852 : ["It is all cultural perspective.  People in the US have bought into the ideas that there may  be beneifts and there is blatent denial of the fact that the procedure removes a source of pleasure from a humans life and messes with sex and masturbation. The denial of the harm of MGM is all about insecurities and the circumcision culture desperately trying to pass the cut onto the next generation.  The cut pushers are using fear propaganda.  Circ does not even lower STD risk (see below).  This is all about passing the cut on to the next generation.  It must be done to infants for only one reason, they will never know what they lost. Circumcision is nerve damage cutting off about 20000 fine touch and stretch sensing nerve endings and removing a source of pleasure from the male FOR LIFE. Thi is 2/3 of the total pleasure source amputated! This is nerves, blood vessels, protective covering and pleasure zones amputated. The dynamics and function and pleasure from sex and masturbation of the penis is harmed for good.  Almost all men circumciced as infants have ED at a much younger age than natural men. Other risks (besides loss of sexual function, ED, PE and loss of PLEASURE) include curved or misshapen erection, painful erection, botches of all sorts (many requiring redo) and death. About 120 boys die each year in the US from this sick practice. There is quite a bit of cultural bias behind the hypocracy.  In the US female circumcision is often said to be to be done only to lessen sexual pleasure and is done under unsanitary conditions.  Like MGM (male circumcision), FGM does always harm sexual pleasure.  However, most FGM is the cutting of the labia and clitoral hood (NOT THE CLITORIS) and it is normally done in a hospital setting.  Women say the sex is fine, say it is cleaner and they want it done to their daughters.  Much male circ in Africa is done in a bush and many many boys die each year.  The point is that both of these practices deprive the owner of the genitals of the full NATURAL capacity for pleasure.  The rare form of FGM is certainly worse than MGM.  However, male circumcision done here in the US takes away more sexual function and pleasure capacity than female circumcision as it is typically done (e.g., in Malaysia).  So they are comparable, if you remove the culture/sex bias. I am against all cutting of the genitals, certainly against all cutting of the genitals without the consent of the person being cut.  I ask that those against FGM also voice their disapproval of MGM.  The rest of the world sees the selective treatment as hypocrisy, which it is. Male and female circ are pushed for the same reasons -- hygiene and looks. Looks is not ra reasonable basis, particularly changing the body of another for your ideas of looks. The Hygiene basis is BS. Circ pushers occasionally do studies and try to say there is a health advantage. A Tanzania study said the FGM (labia and clitoral hood cutting) lowered HIV risk to the cut women. This was also claimed for MGM. I think these are both bogus and rely on other factors to change the risk (sexual practices and number of partners and condom use) from about 3.2% risk to 1.8% risk. The theory is that moist places and/or the type of tissue raises HIV risk. In reality STD and HIV studies in 1st world countries do not show this risk change with male circumcision so it is doubtful there is a risk change for female circumcision. With male circumcision it was found that it raises the risk of HIV to the partners of the circumcised men -- this could also be true of female circumcision. A fact that is certain is that all of these genital cutting practices remove capicity for pleasure of the circumcised. For men the loss is drastic with thousands of fine touch nerve endings cut off. For females the loss is a bit less severe for the most common FGM (labia and clitoral hood removal) and is sexually devastating for the extreme form. Let the human have the chance to experience their natural body. PLEASE Stop all circumcision of minors.", 8847, "SFvFxvdGaa", 9],
	76853 : ["Although I do not condone male circumcision because I feel that it is an issue of consent, it is ludicrous to claim that female circumcision is not worse. \"Female circumcision\", more properly referred to as \"female genital mutilation\" is a very serious women's rights issue. It is actually unrelated to male circumcision. To quote the illustrious Wikipedia, \"this procedure in whatever form it is practiced is not at all analogous to male circumcision and so the term 'female circumcision' gave way to the term 'female genital mutilation'\". Again, \"the term female circumcision 'implies a fallacious analogy to nonmutilating male circumcision, in which the foreskin is cut off from the tip of the penis without damaging the organ itself.'\" It is very important that you realize that comparing the two things is extremely offensive.  Unlike male circumcision, which merely involves cutting the foreskin, female circumcision often involves removing the entire exterior of female genitals, including the clitoris, which is more essential to female sexual pleasure than the G-spot. Most women cannot orgasm without clitoral stimulation, whereas men can easily orgasm regardless of whether or not they are circumcised.  It is also much more dangerous to circumsize women, often leading in painful deaths and an increased risk of HIV and AIDS and increased likelihood of excessive stress.  For men, circumcision is much less detrimental to their health. The American Academy of Pediatrics found that a self-report of circumcised adult men had less sexual dysfunction and more varied sexual practices, with equivocal evidence regarding sensitivity and sexual satisfaction. The complication rate is only around .06%. With regards to disease, Fergusson studied 500 boys and found that by 8 years, the circumcised children had a rate of 11.1 problems per 100 children, and the uncircumcised children had a rate of 18.8 per 100.  Again, I am not trying to advocate for male circumcision. However, the effects of it are not detrimental do not negatively affect your sex life, psychological well-being or risk or infections. I am merely attempting to explain to you that your weird conceptions about female genital mutilation or false and that it is severely worse than male circumcision.", 8847, "dc0dc748f98e1391a07e8387c0d31cf4aa", -7],

	76860 : ["Well Catholics don't really insult anyone. It is the biggest, most diverse and exuberant division of Christianity around. The anglican communion still calls their church Catholic, the oxford movment in the 1830 showed the anglican protestants wanted a return to the old catholic values, the eastern orthodox churches still respect the pope as their head although they do not take orders directly from him. that leaves a tiny minority of churches who do not follow catholicism but still adhere to it's doctrines as standard christian dogma and still revere the pope. the ethiopean church is an entity of its own and there are opther chruches that catholics must let thrive alone as they bring a different cultural aspect to the amazing idelogy of christianity. all christians believe in the same things, some, however, don'tthink too often, others never seem to have read the new testament and others call themselves christian for credit but act badly", 8865, "None", 1],

I honestly didn't know how to have an orgasm on my own until I was 19, and looked it up online; sad but true. People would be insane if they believed that men don't masturbate. Many women, however, can be kept from this behavior by a lack of information. Our society is fairly conservative, so we only talk about the aspect of sexuality that are either a.) dangerous to health, etc. if ignored or b.) obvious, like male masturbation.

	76892 : ["It's not directed to individual Catholics, I know there are sincere, honest hearted individuals that are Catholic.    It's directed to those in charge.    The Popes, the Cardinals, Priests, Nuns....   We know throughout history the Catholic Church has done some awful things in the name of religion.  Burning people on a stake for reading the bible.   They have been involved in wars.   They supported Hitler (there are pictures of Priests \"hieling Hitler\").   The pope's own cousin who was a Priest, tried to get the Pope to do something to help the Jews, he refused to get involved.  So the priest said he was Jewish and was sent to a concentration camp.    He felt the only thing left for him to do was to encourage the Jews.   He did what all religious leaders should have done.   Protestant and Catholic.    Many of the Catholic doctrine are not scriptural.   Purgatory, Hellfire (which the prior Pope admitted there was no burning hell)  Worship of Mary, idol worship.   Why are they not teaching their followers the truth in the bible? The hypocrisy in the higher ups.   The molesting of children by the Priest, which was not handled, but hushed up and the Priest was just moved around, so more children were molested.    Then you hear stories....which they may not be true...hopefully not....that the nuns have become pregnant by the priest and had babies and then killed them.    They have found the remains of babies.   Being involved in politics.   It seems to be more about power, than about the spiritual wellfare of the parishiners. I know that even in modern day that Priests in certain countries have tried to stop other religions from preaching and have spread lies about them and even had them put in prison. With that all being said, don't feel like Catholics are special, just about every religion has been talked about in derogatory terms and even lies spread.    I don't believe anything I said is not true.  It is history.    I think it is good that you have stayed a spiritual person for so long and hope that you do a little research into the bible.   John 17:3 \"This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you the only true God, and the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.\"  Addition: ....I just read your additional comments.   I have a question, why do you feel you need to pray to saints and to Mary to intercede with God?    The bible tells us that Jesus is the only one we can pray through, for our prayers to be heard by God.    This is because he died for our sins.   Where in the bible are we told to pray through Mary or Saints?   According to the bible, God would not hear those prayers.      \"Most truly I say to you,, He that exercises faith in me, that one also will do the works that I do; and he will do works greater than these, because I am going my way to the Father.  Also, whatever it is that you ask in my name, I will do this, in order that the Father may be glorified in connection with the son.\"  John 14: 12 & 13 Jehovah's Witnesses and Morman's have not been consider cults for a long time.
