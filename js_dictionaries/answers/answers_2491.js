	130370 : ["Buy a can of Goop Brand Hand cleaner and apply the night before the show.  Rub in and smooth.  Make sure all the stools are out of the stall last thing at night and I would blanket him with a light fly sheet at least.  Then in the very early morning, wash him with any shampoo - but add 2 T to 16 oz of SHAMPOO of Mrs Wright's bluing - shake til all is mixed - the blueing is found in the Laundry Isle at the grocery store - much cheaper than the blue shampoos.   If his tail is white and badly stained you need to apply it several times before the show for \"overnight\" and then wash with the shampoo/blueing mixture.  Then keep that tail braided and doubled up so it won't get filthy.  If he has BAD stains - start working on them a few days before the show. One of the best things about Goop is that it will not harm the coat or horse (don't let them eat it though) but it is lanolin based so makes the coat shinier and the mane and tail fluffier. As a last min 'fix it' we used to use Corn starch which we dabbed on with cotton balls or a squeeze bottle with a cone top - like they use for hair applicators or like a mustard bottle - fill 1/2 full of corn starch and then puff it on those stockings - the trouble with baby powder is it contains silicone and if it gets in their eyes or they breath a lot of it - it is not good for them.   Goop is on-line but you can usually find it in the auto section in grocery stores like Safeway or at autoparts stores - I would just call around until I found a local source - it is only $2-3.00 depending on size of can but if you have a lot of staining you might need two cans. I used to jump a half Thoroughbred gelding that was an overo and boy was he a lot of work!   We also so used to use a good paste floor wax for white hooves.  Just apply - let stand and buff til they shine!  Future floor wax is great but do not let them walk in water afterwards where as the good paste wax is kind of water proof - lol but NOT mud proof! Good luck!", 11061, "qaiYanF2aa", 0],

I mean, if they just waste our tax money on drugs and alcohol, why keep them around?  \"Tax the living hell out of any service or product that has anything to do with domestic pet species\" So... food doesn't already cost enough? Vet bills aren't enough already? This is taking a step back in time, where only royalty could have dogs.  I think these \"solutions\" are heartless and I would not support them. All animals are living, breathing creatures. It's honestly a bit like an animal Holocaust.  Breeding need to be controlled, though. That is the ONLY thing that needs to be controlled. Not whether or not a dog can find a responsible home.  Around here, most people get their animals fixed, except for those who buy a dog with dollar signs in their eyes. So far it's doing okay. There's more no-kill shelters around here than kill shelters now, because more people are choosing to adopt. And a lot of those people do sports with their dogs, and turn them into working dogs. So it's not like the dogs are useless... every dog has potential if given the right owner. gotta agree with college_girl here and more bored collie and rayven and poppie and ms manners and cjrossi and uhave2be and anne b (most of all anne b) and rotts.

It's a horrible, atrocious reality, but life is exactly that. If irresponsible people would stop purchasing BYB unhealthy swine pups the over-population would significantly be effected positively. Same goes for irresponsible, greedy filth of society using their dogs as ATM machines. If they want to make money, be like the rest of us and go to work Mon-Fri 9-5. Not a hard concept. The issue is how the euthanization is swept under the rug. How many politicians and government representatives have publicly voiced a better solution, or even acknowledged to the general public this ACTUALLY happens?

We believe that after the Apostles died, the priesthood Jesus gave to the Apostles (which enables them to act in the name of God) was lost as well as many true doctrines. Many churches of Christ were made but they were divided ridiculously constantly arguing over the nature of God, predestination, etc. We believe in the Bible as the inspired word of God, and we believe the same with the Book of Mormon. We believe the Book of Mormon was written by ancient peoples in America that knew of Jesus Christ. We believe Joseph Smith helped restore the Church of Jesus Christ onto Earth and by the power of God translated the ancient plates that became the Book of Mormon. We believe that revelations are still happening today, unlike many Christians (Lutherans, Episcopalians, Methodists). We have prophets, like the early Christian Church, who deliver prophecies and help instruct the Church of Jesus Christ. We believe before we came to Earth we lived with the Heavenly Father in peace and that we chose to come to Earth to grow and to prove our faith to Jesus Christ and the Father.  We believe Jesus Christ died for all man's sins, so when we die we go to either Spirit Prison or Paradise. In Spirit Prison you learn about Jesus Christ and God and His Church. Then we are all resurrected, and we go to a different degree of Heaven, except for those who felt God, knew about God and lived and worked against God, they go to the outer-darkness. This isn't like mainstream Christianity because they believe just Heaven and Hell, and that the majority of man will go to Hell, where we believe almost all man will go to Heaven, but the most righteous who followed God on Earth will go to the highest degree in which God and Jesus reside and we can have our families forever. In Christian theology, the family relationships will melt away in Heaven. That's our church's theology in about a minute.
