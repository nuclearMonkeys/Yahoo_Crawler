	38535 : ["If you are getting the opportunity for an interview, then it sounds like you may need to work on your interviewing skills, but better than that, why don't you just ask the places you've interviewed if they could tell you what you could do better so that you could be more successful at your next interview. Also ask a friend or two for a recommendation where they are working at. As far as your appearance, you can only work with what you've got. Make sure that your hygiene is at it's best, dress business casual at the very least, if you have tattoos or some other abnormalities on your face or person then maybe you can bring it up in a joking matter to get it out of the way and get the focus on what you can do to assist the employer.  I've been a supervisor and manager and have interviewed several people in my lifetime. I've not hired people because they stunk, spoke horribly, came to the interview late, wore clothes that looked like they just came from a heavy-metal concert, where lying, and where high, and the list goes on, but being unattractive was not one of my decisions for a non-hire.", 5664, "L2CrEzTBaa", 4],

	38539 : ["You probably won't get another offer, just so you know.  You can also ignore all the get-a-lawyer answers, because they're dead wrong.  Unless you were injured in the crash, no lawyer wants to take your case.  No money in it for them unless you're hurt. I've handled over a thousand accident settlements myself, and I've yet to see a single person who thought they were paid what (in their opinion) their vehicle was actually worth.  I've seen people curse and swear, provide pages of for-sale listings for comparable vehicles, threaten court action, and write letters to everyone including (possibly) JollyOld .com to register complaints.  And only one of them got any success in their pursuits.  Here's why... When insurance companies offer a settlement, they've already done the necessary homework.  They know that any claim could be audited by whoever regulates insurance companies where you live (there's one in every jurisdiction), and they know that any claim could end up in front of a judge at any time.  They also know that if they don't have all their documentation in perfect order every single time, the regulatory authority and / or judge will absolutely crucify them.  Whether the claim is for 20 bucks or 20 million, they're expected and required to follow due diligence without fail.  That's what they do for a living every day, and that's why they don't get scared when customers threaten to get a lawyer.  But give it a try anyway, because there's no reason you can't ask.  They might kick it up by a hundred or two, because your vehicle had (just for example) an upgraded stereo or those cheesy pimp-lights or whatever.  If you ask nicely and provide them with some sort of coherent reason, the worst thing they can do is say no.  They won't blame you for asking. How did that one guy do it, you ask?  He hired his own independent appraiser to do a complete without-prejudice (that's a legal term) assessment of the vehicle's value, and he presented it to the insurance company.  The insurance company either accepted the second independent appraisal, or they accepted that it wasn't worth spending $25,000 to prepare for a trial over a few thousand bucks in settlement.  And that's just the cost of preparing for a trial, things get expensive after that.", 5691, "M0akEw8Vaa", 0],
	38540 : ["Under hard acceleration the weight of the car shifts to the rear as the torque causes the front end to rise. If you don't limit the torque to the front wheels the front tires will break loose. Since many AWD systems use the brakes to control wheel spin, preventing it in the first place by shifting torque to the rear wheels will allow for harder controlled acceleration. Still, having both axles applying torque allows more rubber to grip the pavement.  How this is accomplished depends on the specific vehicle. Some now drive one axle with electric motors, some use viscous coupling and some use electro-mechanical means to shift torque front or rear. ", 5692, "hD25pT1Laa", 4],
	38541 : ["No, all that's doing is making your speedometer and odometer inaccurate by 3%. When you read 60 mph on the speedo, you will actually be going only about 58 mph. Similarly, your odometer will be off, everytime you go 100 miles, you will only have gone about 97 miles. Your tire dealer should have actually replaced your 255/55/18's with 235/60/18's instead, because those would have almost identical circumference (off by a mere 0.2% which is nothing).  However, that being said, none of that will affect the shaking at high speeds. That's entirely due to an unbalanced tire, perhaps a balancing weight has broken off the rim? Or perhaps they did a bad job of balancing it. Just go back to the tire place and tell them about it, and that it shaking at high speeds, and to have them rebalance the tires again.", 5693, "bz34wCGSaa", 1],

So, I was told to tell you this so that I won't be punished by God. Sorry, if the warning came out wrong Police will stop you at checkpoints to see if you're chipped (aka vaccinated) Chipped will be influenced to receive World Passport (grey plastic card with no name on it)... but when they stretch their hands to get (gov't clerk will press secret button to administer) the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays This Tom guy and saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov both said that once you hide: no documents / no electronics / etc. so that nothing holds you back and you won't go back into the city ‘cuz police will stop to chip you if you decide to go back.

The US is the 51st unhealthiest country in the world, Australia is the 14th healthiest.", 5696, "74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa", 0],
