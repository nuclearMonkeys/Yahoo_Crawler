	83557 : ["It's going to be a sad day in America when beauty counts as a qualification for the highest office in country. Palin couldn't tell Charlie Gibson and Katie Couric what the duties of a Vice President are, what the Bush Doctrine was, what was another groundbreaking decision besides Roe v. Wade...ummm.. how about Brown vs. the Board of Education which led to school desegregation. Palin thought the V.P. could make law which is not true. Call her and ask her some questions and maybe she'll \"get back to ya\".", 9137, "493063d6139840a25805427e0c89ce9aaa", 1],
	83558 : ["Sarah Palin as US president is a truly terrifying prospect - for the whole planet. Surely at least some element of a pre-requisite to be leader of your great nation should be that an ounce of intelligence should be required? She comes across as vapid and poorly educated, with little grasp of the world outside Alaska let alone the world outside the US. Like it or not, when Americans vote, you vote for the most powerful individual on the planet. That awesome responsibility should demand that the candidates are more than pretty faces without a couple of brain cells to rub together.", 9137, "None", 4],

	83562 : ["I don't think she'll have much of a chance in the primaries.   Quitting partway through her first term does not speak well of her, and is likely to be used against her both in the primaries and in the very unlikely possibility of her reaching the general election. Her strongest base is social conservatives, where she will likely be opposed by Mike Huckabee - former three term Governor of Arkansas and first runner up for the 2008 Nomination.  Meanwhile, Tim Pawlenty - Governor of Minnesota (now in his second term) is setting up groundwork to run as the fresh face and Washington outsider.  Plus there's Romney, who took a close third in the 2008 Primaries, and has solid organizational skills.  The GOP can do a lot better than Palin, and they probably will.", 9139, "xgw7tZfDaa", 1],
	83563 : ["No, and if she does it will be for the same reason why The Terminator is in charge of California- for the people's sake of entertainment. But I did heard something about the United Talk Show Host Front. Apparently, they're secretly conspiring against the people in order to get Palin elected. They say Obama simply isn't stupid enough- and they're right.", 9139, "None", 2],
	83564 : ["Palin isn't stupid.  She won't give up this most lucrative gig of writing books and going on the talk circuit at a $100 thousand a pop !  She's in the money and it's doubtful that she is so power hungry that she would re enter the race. Palin is smart too, she won't announce her intentions.  It is not even a remote thought of the GOP to endorse Palin, so that would be one big hurdle if she did decide to run. The Republicans will not make the same mistake as they did in 2008.  The GOP candidate will certainly be someone who can beat 0bama.   One who will resurface is Romney, and he will be the guy to beat !", 9139, "None", -1],

A dirty house would indicate an elderly person who no longer can do what needs doing, a depressed person who needs more help than a hand with the dirty dishes, a person with physical disabilities who can't clean the house from, say, a wheelchair, or even just a plain old lazy person who overlooks the cobwebs in favor of reading or even watching TV. Thinking of witches is just so bizarre that I'm near speechless with astonishment at your question. Besides, as we all know, witches have never existed and gods are make-believe.

	83580 : ["No way, not going to happen. Besides she has already figured out that she can make more money as a talking head then she could ever dream to make as a politician. THAT is the reason she quit her job as governor. Therefore she will never run for it.. unless she intended to lose again and then \"write\" another book. Oh please.. Liberals are not afraid of her, there is no way she could possibly win .. just having her as the VP candidate caused record numbers of her own party to stay home.

She was and is COMPLETELY unqualified to run for any high political office---heck, she couldn't even bring herself to finish the term as Alaska's elected governor, selling out the voters for the sake of the almighty dollar---so typical of the cult-evangelical Republicans!
