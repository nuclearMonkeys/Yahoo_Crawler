Maybe you could try it in a smoothie so it gets chopped up super fine. Greens and vegetabels like that are super hard to digest.

Some places around the world have now outlawed the tight confinement of what are called battery cages for laying hens. It's not just vegans or even vegetarians who has called for that to change. Of course in some videos of what's called free range, are poorly done. It really doesn't take much to have a flock of chickens flock together outside that actually are free range. All one needs is a bucket of something like cracked corn, and throw it out on the ground, and the chickens will flock together to get it.   As for honey, some of it's in the way that bees are handled, that vegans have issues with. However for vegans there is with some a bit of a quandary over them. Some do realize that they are very dependent on bees, for a great deal of what they eat, due to pollenization especially many types of fruits. However bees often will make more than they can, or will use over the course of a year or season. Part of the problem also lies in that a tiny minority will kill off their entire colony to get the honey.   As for the generalization that most animals suffer goes, very few actually suffer while they're being raised, and all the way through to slaughter. Most of that has been put out by PETA, and a few other groups perhaps who has known for exaggerating things or creating videos. Some members has actually gone onto farms, and has gone as far as portray themselves as farm workers, to show the animals are mistreated. Then in other cases getting jobs on a farm, to mistreat, and \"document\" the mistreatment of animals. It was for that reason some places created laws that now make for setting up such \"documentation\", illegal.   While I agree that there are definitely some really bad people and places out there, where mistreatment does occur, it's not anywhere near as rampant or common place as PETA and some other groups would have people believing. It helps with building the disconnect between the source of where food comes from, by using such videos, to try to convince those in urban and suburban areas, as what goes on farms. But I've also seen other areas of where there's some type of a disconnect from reality, and in livestock, and with food and nutrition in general.

	45824 : ["Orthodoxy is the only true faith. Rapture = heresy; Fireball should be beheaded for spreading this heresy on Yahoo Answers (deceiving Christians into false hope). Dreams/thoughts are from 1)angels who always do good; 2)demons who never do good; or 3)you making shyt up in your head while you sleep trying to solve your problems; or from 4) your gov't using this supertechnology. Usually, dreams/thoughts are from demons. So, that explains a lot of people being in the wrong all the time. Rapture thing is from demons but you can't rule out the gov't using some super technology like Project Blue Beam to kind of introduce people to the evil flying antichrist who will ride on a donkey into the Third Temple. So, churches who closed for COVID (or had COVID measures like dipping spoon into some liquid like alcohol) are no longer Christ's but now are working for Satan promoting the new COVID religion. Last Patriarch is Patriarch Irenaios 1st. He blessed Catacomb movement. For liturgy what you need is antiminis (towel with remains of saints sewn into it); wax candles; one cup/one spoon; non-Kosher non-yeast non-barcoded non-qrcoded wine/bread. Kosher = sprinkled with blood. Yeast is grown on pig bacteria. QRcode = barcode = mark of the beast. Roman Catholics tried one cup and one spoon and got sick with Bubonic plague (no laughing matter). You must hide (within a small group of 10-15 people according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov) in order to escape the unforgivable mark of the beast. No documents once you hid because documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. No electronics once you hid because antichrist's minions will track you using electronics that you got. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the antichrist using Tesla's ether. In case you're in 'Murica and want to hide, then consider inland Alaska. Arctic Circle = Security Circle for WW3.
