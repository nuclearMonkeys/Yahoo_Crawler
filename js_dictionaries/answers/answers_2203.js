Natural gas has a rotten egg smell added as an indicator. The one that I run into a lot is if someone has been painting or varnishing, doing something with flammable gases, whenever those gasses come in contact with and open flame they will give off an odor.

	115966 : ["Wow, good, and tough, question! Holly (22), Hendrix(27), and Lennon(40): I think they all had a lot left in them, and they had all accomplished a lot. Holly because of the circumstances of his being in the plane. He had a very bad cold (possibly flu), it was 18 degrees, and the heater in the bus was broken. And he was the youngest. Accident. Hendrix because of the circumstances surrounding his death. My understanding of this was that the ambulance attendant kept propping his head up and that he died of suffocation (not drugs, although they were a contributing factor) because of vomit. Ineptness. Lennon because of his remarkable ability and willingness to take chances, adapt, and survive. Murder. I have to go with Lennon, even though he was the oldest, and had accomplished the most, because of his willingness to put it all on the line for family and personal convictions. Also because his death was a deliberate act instead of an accident or ineptness. He was also still producing great tunes from \"Give Peace A Chance\" to \"Working Class Hero\" to \"Imagine\" and \"Watching The Wheels Go 'Round And 'Round\".", 10451, "S71MT9USaa", 2],

The end bacon is better than center-cut in my opinion as the fat gives us all that flavor. High heat will release the fat faster, and the bacon will fry in its own fat at a higher temperature and hence be more crispy.   Low heat releases the fat slower, and the temperature of the released fat will not crisp the bacon as much (for those who like it chewy). I like medium/high heat - you know the bacon is close to being done when you see lots of very little oil bubbles forming on the top of each strip.", 10447, "xknLazokaa", 0],

Then, when Julia Roberts became popular, I noticed how much she looked like Barbara, and people seemed to think Julia was \"beautiful\". Funny how time and styles change, and how people's perceptions of things are always different. There is no truly \"ugly\" person. If you're ugly on the outside and beautiful on the inside, your \"ugliness\" becomes less obvious.
