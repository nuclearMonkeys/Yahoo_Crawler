	105431 : ["The best place for the antenna is on top of the middle of the cab or a 102\" whip (plus spring) mounted outside of the bed. The instructions with your antenna should give some suggestions. A mag-mount will work as well as other base or center loaded antennas, it just has a temporary look to it. If the back rack is metal, It's probably OK too. Half of the antenna is the metal of the truck (the ground plain). I've always been a little suspicious of mirror mounts due to the lack of metal they are connected to. If they can specify what their typical SWR would be and that is 1.5 or less, they're OK too.  The quality of how well an antenna performs is the gain specification. This is listed in dBi (decibels relative to isotropic) or dBd (decibels relative to dipole) . An isotropic radiator is a theoretical antenna with a gain of 1 dB. A dipole is a real world antenna that has a gain of about 2.15 dBi. Some CB antenna manufacturers list the gain (if they list it at all) as dBi. It makes the antenna gain look a little better.
