	124221 : ["I am most amazed by what they are NOT teaching children in school today.   The school seems more concerned with its politically correct agendas than with actual education.  There are two fifth grades, and they refuse to separate them by ability.  My grandson is held back to the level of the slowest kid in the class.  His mind has to take trips and he loses focus.  The boy is not being challenged.  Then the slower students are not getting the more intense attention that they need.  No one gains what they should be gaining.   Grandson scores an average of two years above grade level, but is getting straight B+'s from his current teacher.  He was straight A's.  He is starting to complain of being bored.   He also cpmplains about the teacher tightly restricting and censoring classroom discussion.   He recognizes the distinct liberal bias in his Social Studies Text and class.  They are reading and iscussing the Civil War, and when grandson pointed out the superior integrity and character of Robert E. Lee, comparinghim to generals of the north, the teacher got really upset.  She resented him presenting facts that call the politically correct biases of the text into question.   Unfortunately, I fear that the boy will become a bit of a \"sleeper\" until he gets to college. He told the class that the government is going to send money to their parents and grandparents in may, and that they, the kids, are going to have to pay for it when they start working, because the government has no money; it is in debt!  The teacher was upset with him.   WHY?", 10779, "None", 3],
