Additional tips about FF: I use and recommend a simultaneous dual browser arrangement: You can have as many different browsers open as you want at the same time , without significant slowdowns. Attacks from the internet, using 'blended' methods are becoming more pronounced. Windows users are especially vulnerable due to the systems flexibility which permits remote machines to enter & access other 3rd party applications on your machine and get it to do something it was not intended to do. This is especially true of using browsers as 'launchpads' for payload delivery.  IE, being deeply woven into Windows, is a prime target, and makes using Firefox, with 'noScript' add on even more urgent.   Use Firefox for general & everyday surfing needs, especially to sites you don't know anything about.  Depending on how many plug-in's and add-on's you \"hang\" onto FF, it's faster than IE, & inherently safer. Try viewing a site with FF first, and if it does not allow the interaction you require, switch & use IE (but only when it's absolutely necessary), or to use 'Active X' or 'Flash' scripting: but use these at your own peril.   Flip back to FF when finished. ************** Note:  Current threats include 'Antivirus 2009' or variants. Because architecture of the Internet (notably 'Flash' scripting), vulnerabilities are readily exploited in Internet Explorer, & it is now >>urgent<< that you use Firefox with current 'NoScript' add-on, which will prevent \"opacity-based attacks\".

	116189 : ["At some point in our lives, we all experience grief. It might be from the breakup of a marriage or the death of a beloved child or friend. Regardless of the cause, grief is a normal and natural response to loss and/or change.Everyone reacts to loss differently and while we may share some feelings and thoughts, there is no right or wrong way to experience this. Grieving is a process, one with no set time frame for \"progress\" or \"success\". think of it as a journey that is long and difficult, with bumpy spots and smooth ones, hills and valleys. Sometimes we need to travel alone, other times we need friends and family to help us through. But I don't think the journey ends. Rather there may be points where we stop to rest, to recoup and gather our thoughts, but I don't think we ever come to a complete stop.Sometimes we want to confront God and demand an explanation, an apology, ask Him why He took someone who meant so very much to our heart's.Im sure you've serached for some redeeming value in their deaths,Some reason for it, some great revelation that will explain it all.make some sense,some purpose in all of this.and Im also sure you havent found it yet....I know this is harder on you and your family then it is on any of us, and for that I am so very sorry,Your not some super mom who has just bounced back and that's okay sweetheart.the difficult life they had here is over,I'm sad for those of you who they had to leave behind,It's my personal belief that the dead have down time. Call it 'the big sleep', call it 'asleep in Jesus', call it what you will. But I believe that upon death, the spirit removes to some other place. Perhaps it spends time recovering from the world's grievances, perhaps it is not at all aware of the former life, death, loved ones, etc., perhaps it isn't aware of anything. But I believe that when Jesus returns to our world, and yes, I do believe He will, the dead in Christ will rise first to be with Him, then the living in Christ shall be with Him. It's my opinion that at that point in time,You will finally see your precious children again...don't give up in yourself or in God.Go ahead and cry. It's okay Don't fight your feelings. Guilt can be a normal part of grief.Please tell your friends and family how they can be supportive.I don't know how you feel, but I care about you and that you are hurting.Each day may seem like a burden,sometimes it will be hard to face.I offer you my sincerest condolences on the loss of your children.although there are no words to ease your grief at this difficult time I do hope that my words will offer you some kind of comfort.Understanding the nature of grief can help us better cope with loss. Grief is a natural, healthy process that enables us to recover from terrible emotional wounds.Jesus is our best role model for combining faith and grief, as revealed in John 11:1-45. When He saw Mary and Martha in anguish over the death of their brother Lazarus, He wept and groaned. Although Jesus knew He was about to raise Lazarus from the dead, He still allowed Himself to feel – and express – the depths of human sorrow.We can take comfort in knowing that Jesus has experienced all of our pain, including loss, rejection, betrayal, and dying. As our Savior and Redeemer, He took all our sins to the cross and forgives us when we ask. As our Good Shepherd, He leads us safely through “the valley of the shadow of death” (Psalm 23:4b). Remember, a shadow indicates that there is a light on the other side! Im sure your saying Don't they understand that I'd rather have my children with me.Don't they know I remember the pain my children might have suffered before they died? Can't they understand that my mind is so numb I can't even think of what needs to be done? Of course these wonderful,concerned, well-meaning true honest people on this site don't know unless of course they have been through this...They can only guess how the newly bereaved feel,I haven't personally known (thank God) the disbelief, the shock, the anger of losing a child. Instead of bringing relief, those words just seem to add to the hurt and the grief. There are no words that will make it all right that someone we loved has died. But there are words that can soothe the hurt, ease the loneliness and add to the healing.You need to express your anger, your frustration. I know it must be hard for you to believe that God is a loving God who will support you through this horrible tragedy.With all this being said please know that I am still thinking of you and your family...May God be with you all..  * this is what I would say to the mother if I could....           best wishes", 10451, "4ab49b667ab5c824be9acaba19e1027caa", 1],

Kettle Corn   Submitted by: Sue Rated: 5 out of 5 by 232 members Prep Time: 5 Minutes Cook Time: 15 Minutes Ready In: 20 Minutes Yields: 5 servings \"White sugar makes the Kettle Corn taste like popcorn balls. Use brown sugar and it will taste like caramel corn.\" INGREDIENTS: 1/2 cup unpopped popcorn kernels 1/4 cup white sugar 1/4 cup vegetable oil DIRECTIONS: 1. Place the popcorn and sugar in a large pot with vegetable oil. Over a medium heat, begin to pop the popcorn. Constantly shake the pot to ensure that the popcorn kernels and oil do not burn. Once the popping has slowed, remove the pot from heat. Kettle Corn Recipe Reference : Recipes I was at a big fair once and got some kettle corn. It was really good. Here's a recipe for Kettle Corn that you can do at home. You might want some adult supervision. Hot splashing oil can burn you if you're not careful. Kettle Corn Ingredients: 1/4 cup corn oil 1/4 cup popcorn 1/4 cup sugar salt Directions: Use a decent size pot (with a lid) and pour in enough oil to have about an 1/8\" covering the bottom. Don't use too much oil. Too much oil will sog the popped popcorn and you'll probably get sick to your stomach when you eat it. Dump in enough popcorn to make a single layer in the pot. Put the pot on medium high heat. When you see the corn start to get excited but before it starts to pop, quickly pour in the sugar as evenly as you can across the top. Cover and shake back and forth to pop (like Jiffy Pop). When you pull it off you need to slightly salt it. You can't pop every single kernel because you would scorch the popcorn. Also pouring in the sugar too soon tends to make the popcorn scorch more easily. If you pour it in too late, the sugar stays granular and grainy. Also get the popped popcorn out of the pot as quickly as possible to prevent scorching.", 10458, "AA11154560", 0],
