	64612 : ["I'm convinced that Goldman is the firm that we have to take on. Goldman is not simply the one taking advantage of us through our government. Goldman is the driving force that pushes all these corrupt politicians to giving them the farm. Goldman needs to be named today's robber baron. Goldman needs to be the face of this. We need to find a catch phrase explain the catch phrase and then simply invoke that name when we need to people to understand who's the bad guy. I think that the name should be Goldmanite. Goldmanite is a robber baron. A person or group that seeks to gain unfair advantages by screwing the American people. They gain the system, take irresponsible risks, screw everyone but themselves and get a bonus for doing it. They control our politicians including Barrack Obama.  People are still quoting Gordon Gecko and saying that greed is good. People insist that the free market is great. How do we stop this shier and utter non-sense and ignorance as to actual corporate welfare that is going on. My answer is to continue telling people over and over. Whether the person asking the question aske a good one (like this question) or an ignorant one (like are the rich paying to much tax, they pay 60% of the total tax burden - NON SENSE.) Just keeping telling the story, tell them fact show them their ignorance. I have faith that it has an impace. Back to Goldman. They paid 1% tax last year, how is that not corporate welfare. People put down others on welfare but what about Goldman they are the top receiver of corporate welfare. They get whatever they want money, securities, guarantee's, laws, destruction of their competition and ability to act irresponsible. They cannot do anything wrong whatever they do they will end up benefiting in one way and the other. Not one way or the other, One way and the other, They benefit going down and going up and staying stable. You name it the benefit left and right. How is this free?", 8269, "XdqOkH20aa", 2],
	64613 : ["I don't know what to say about Goldman Sachs.  There is without question some illegal, sketchy, and crooked stuff occurring on Wall Street.  I think the entire system is out of control, and I think a lot of other factors besides the free market controls Wall Street and the stock market.   I have not completely figured it out yet, but am getting close. Goldman Sachs is a very elite group on Wall Street, but has faced some very serious criticism recently about criminal activity and conspiracy to control both the market and US government for illegal gains.  The games they play on Wall Street are very difficult for people outside the loop to figure out.  I would say there is likely some truth in the accusations against Goldman Sachs, it is at the tip of the spear of a very elite good ole boy network, and I have no idea what their profits mean.  It could mean the Wall Street crooks have regained control and have started to do business as usual again.  It could be a bad thing, or maybe it is a sign of the market rebounding.  It is hard for me to figure out.", 8269, "j8gHQ3PAaa", -1],

	64615 : ["LOL If we were under a free market, Goldman Sachs would not exist anymore because it would have failed and gone bankrupt.
