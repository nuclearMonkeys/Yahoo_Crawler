It was super high end when it was new. So it's still plenty powerful for what it's being used for. 8 gigs ram. 2.2ghz dual core processor. Nvidia GPU. It's more powerful then some brand new budget machines being sold today. So it's perfectly fine. I set it up for my mom to use. She only uses it for Facebook and online banking and to play Mahjong. It's got plenty of power for that.  My current machine that i use was built from all second hand parts. So no idea how old it actually is. It's a Frankenstein. But she's got plenty of power. I have maybe $300 invested in it in used parts. it's keeping up with of the shelf machines in the $2500 dollar range. So....  Honestly i can't complain. I haven't purchased a brand new computer in probably 20 years. I just keep repurposing and upgrading older hardware. :)   ", 6203, "oYSKFdnlaa", 0],

	42967 : ["Luck=Moloch=demon.Gov't is killing you with high frequency electricity. Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to \"Schema-nun Antonia\" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (The Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbrings them up alevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put these wreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofTheotokosVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints. Crosses on solesofshoesandbackofpants are blasphemy. Demons makecarpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walkoncrosses. Playingcards mockhow Jesus sufferedonthecross: clubs(cross on which Jesus wascrucified), diamonds (fournails Jesus was crucifiedwith), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesuswas given to drink),spades (spear with whichJesus waspierced).Cremationisdevilworship; onlyblasphemers suchasLenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this. AfterChinaattacksRussia, RuskiOrthodoxTsar (shown by resurrected SeraphimofSarov) willcome topowerinRussia;this Tsar will slay traitors insideChurch andgov't; asaresult, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism=263heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same SupremeBeing [aka thedevil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism will have Pagans walking on theirheads in hell. ArkhimandriteAntoninKapustin left a prophecy that Church of All Russian Saints in Gorny Monastery, EinKarem, Israel will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist; pseudoPatriarchKirillofRussia and MarkofBerlin blessed thischurchin2007.

	42983 : ["You don't have a lot of options regarding upgrade potential, but here's the rundown of things... * RAM: NO UPGRADE REQUIRED -- Unless you're shooting for 1440p or 4K (2160p), you should have enough RAM to handle virtually every game.  Unless you're planning to host a server on your computer, any extra RAM would go unused. * CPU: Upgrade Potential, but not feasible due to architecture -- While your i7-6700 is currently 4 CPU generations old (at time of post), there's some potential with an upgrade to an i7-10700.  This change would give your system a potential 25% boost in performance.  If you have the unlocked version (i7-6700K, as you claim speeds of 4.0 Ghz vs 3.5 Ghz for the locked version), the performance boost drops to around 18% on average. HOWEVER, the 10th Gen i7 processor has double the cores than your current processor (8 cores w/ HT vs 4 cores w/ HT), so it can multitask a bit better even though the clock speed is slightly slower (maxing out at 3.8 Ghz).  This may require changing your PC's motherboard, which can easily snowball into replacing other components...  so it may not be feasible due to costs & time required to complete this change. * Graphics Card: UPGRADE POTENTIAL -- While you had a high-end graphics card at the time, it's current 2-3 generations old & the current guideline is that for each generation you go up, you drop one level of effective performance (NOT 100% accurate, but it provides a reasonable comparison)...  So that GTX 1070 = GTX 1560 = RTX 2050 = RTX 3040 (I know RTX 2050 & 3040 don't exist, but humor me here). If you want to upgrade here, you'll want to jump to RTX 2070 or RTX 3070 in order see a significant performance gain (since the GTX 1570 wouldn't provide the desired performance boost).  HOWEVER, your system might run into some performance bottlenecks with the motherboard. How you proceed with upgrades is up to you, but this give you an idea on where to focus your efforts.", 6220, "5d801299a74e13682dc0885d3c2692a7aa", 1],
	42984 : ["To be fair, Jewish peoplehood isn't technically an ethnic identity. A lot of people do treat Jewishness as an ethnicity but that's because Jews of one area are usually of one type (e.g., most Jews in Poland are Ashkenazi, most in Iraq were Mizrahi). However, Israel is the collection of all Jews so describing them all as one ethnic group just doesn't work, even if the ethnic groups are still described as being rather close and from similar descent. Now, understanding that there are multiple ethnic groups in Israel helps you see that Israel is really moving past ethnic isolationism within its populace and is mixing at a noticeable rate. When Israel was re-established, most stayed with their own group but nowadays most Israelis are actually \"mixed\", ethnically wise. A lot of Israelis are part-this, part-that; and, while I don't know the current data, a decade ago it was said that 50% of Israelis were \"mixed race\" in this way. One cousin I have is 50%-Sephardi, 25%-Ashkenazi and 25%-Mizrahi, for instance. So while some people do see this as \"Jews marrying Jews\", to a more nuanced observer this is a much more diversifying force. Now, with the term \"racial\" in play, that adds a bit of controversy into this. Most Jewish groups can classify as \"white\"... depending on who you ask. White Supremacists will call all Jews \"non-white\" whereas some modern commentators of race will deem all Jews as \"white\". None of this takes into account that Ashkenazi Jews can have skin tones that are noticeably tanner than many other Middle Easterners, or that some Yemenite Jews who look incredibly Middle Eastern are just classified as \"white\" in this system. Based on some framing on your part, I'm assuming you classify Jews as \"white\" whereas Arabs as \"non-white\"... but, the predominant ethnic group in Israel (when we bother to break it down) is Mizrahi, the MIDDLE EASTERN Jews who lived in lands now described Arab. Some even call them \"Arab Jews\" (note: Do not call Middle Eastern Jews that, it's considered an erasure of their unique identity). And all ethnic Jewish groups have Middle Eastern genetics, so you can see where your question has an issue you probably never accounted for. Israeli Arab and Israeli Jewish issues do exist, but they're social in nature. They aren't ethnic or racial, despite what some people believe. After all, if you consider the Ashkenazi Jews different on that level from the Arabs and the Mizrahi Jews the same (as a lot of people ignorantly do), then the group you consider \"the same\" as Arabs are the more prejudiced towards them whereas the Ashkenazis, the \"different ones\", are the more accepting. Studies show that Mizrahim tend to be more hostile to Arabs on average, which is attributed to how poorly they were treated when they were in Arab lands. Still, Israelis tend to recognize that there are issues and there are many programs that are launched to bring them closer. All Israelis are already legally equal, but the Jewish and Arab groups still tend to avoid each other, and it's seen as a problem overall. So these programs exist... but, not with post-racial theories in mind. Respect for their differences is still a thing as well.", 6231, "hKgjv1Deaa", -1],
