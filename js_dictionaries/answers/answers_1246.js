I really feel sorry for all of those who think that the president is, or should be, some all powerful dictator with total control over our well being.  Those who are blaming the president for the economy are proof of how poor our current education system is.   The president is of little significance to the economy.  For that matter so is congress.  Actually government can not create wealth.  That is a fact.  Anyone who says otherwise is ignorant on economic matters.   There are so many people, institutions, and cultural trends putting us in this mess that the blame has to put on everyone.  This is not just a left or a right problem - THIS IS AN AMERICAN PROBLEM!!   This is not just from actions in the last year.  It hasn't been the last 8.  Some economists are pointing back 30 years.  I would go back about 40 to the late 60's.   Our manufacturing base has been slowly eroding.  We import more and export less.  We have fallen victim to a consumerist mindset where we spend money on disposable goods and have little to show for income.  We don't save but borrow heavily.  There is an expectation of reward without any risk.  There is an entitlement mindset and a need to blame a force greater than ourselves for any shortcomings.   We have an education system which is content to send youth out into the world who believe that buying a new wardrobe, computer, car, ... will actually help the economy.  We have banks and other lending institutions which have no problem enabling our need for constant credit but refuse to take responsibility when the overdrafts get too great and they can no longer find enough new victims to makeup for  the shortfall.  Then we have government at local, state, and the federal level which has been even more reckless, and we willingly reelect the same crooks over and over.   It doesn't matter if we elected Lew Rockwell, Ludwig von Mises, Milton Friedman or some other great economist to lead us, they could not single handedly get us out of this mess.
