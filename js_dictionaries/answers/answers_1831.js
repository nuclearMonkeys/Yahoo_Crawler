See if you can take any advanced placement courses. Now or mid-year. Advanced placement courses tend to be taught by the most experienced teachers who know how to teach not the ones who go through the motions by assigning you pages out of the textbook and giving you busy work. They also give you an advantage when applying to colleges.  C. Discuss whether or not you have the option to transfer to another school, and when. Get the paperwork to do it. Get out of there ASAP. Why are you going to a school that is rated 5th lowest in the state?!!!!!! You belong at a school for the gifted and talented. Or a magnet school.  #2  Make an appointment with your doctor. Tell him/her about your thoughts of suicide. You may need some medication to help you. Ask him/her to refer you to someone for your depression. They will also help you with feeling like a social outcast, dealing with your parents, and problems with school.  Your doctor can talk to your parents if you need him/her to.  If you are afraid that you act on your thoughts about committing suicide then go to the nearest ER even if you have to call 911 to get there.  Do not leave until they get you help.

Still going through it, he has me down to 1 mg a day now, but he gave me zoloft for panic/anxiety/depression.  I got worse.  Vomiting, tremors, derealization, like I had Alzheimers.  I went back to him.  He gave me Lexapro, which is suppose to help with panic/anxiety/depression.  So far so good with it.  Not any of the side effects I dealt with the zoloft.  All vomiting has stopped. I guess where I am getting at, is first DONT SELF DIAGNOSIS. Go to your doctor first and let them help you.  I learned a bittersweet lesson, trust me.  There are all kinds of therapies, meds that can help you past this.  Take one day at a time.

Mormon missionaries are like telemarketers except they show up at your door instead of calling first. They aren't the problem, really, since they just parrot back what they've been told to say. They do it mostly because the internal morg cultural pressure expects young men to serve a mission, but they're not equipped theologically or maturely to properly introduce the unique mormon view of themselves.  It's the message, the timing of the message, and the messengers themselves that many people have issues with, while the church simply brushes it of with \"They are not ready to receive the gospel...yady yada yada.\" Ever notice that mormons get all pissy when anyone tries to convert them, but feel it is perfectly acceptable to send 60,000 of these guys out to convert the rest of us?
