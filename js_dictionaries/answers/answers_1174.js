Science explains the big bang was not from nothing but from a singularity that was all the matter and energy in the universe compressed into a single point that then expanded rapidly! So it was always here! But why are BAD Christians LIKE YOU always claiming the big bang came from nothing? Are they that ignorant? Did they sleep through school or is it that they know the truth but think they can twist it because everyone is gullible?! Claiming something cannot come from nothing argues not against the big bang but against creationists claims! Which extremist sect or cult indoctrinated you to believe that God was not clever enough to use the big bang, evolution and science as his tools? Pope Francis says the theories of evolution and the Big Bang are real and God is not “a magician with a magic wand” putting an end to the “pseudo theories” of creationism and intelligent design!   So the Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept the big bang and evolution! Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well – “Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth”!  Christian Fundamentalist is a complete contradiction in terms! CHRISTIAN – A follower or believer in Jesus. FUNDAMENTALIST One who believes the Bible is literally true and must be followed exactly. Therefore they are followers of the bible and not Jesus making them non Christians!  But worse is to follow it also makes them ideologists. IDEOLOGY An idea that is false or held for the wrong reasons but is believed with such conviction as to be irrefutable.

We know this because of the Law of Gravity, and mass. Had there been matter prior to the Big Bang it would have formed a black hole so immense that nothing would have ever escaped.  Instead we find ballistic trajectories of all Universal matter away from a single set of coordinates - as all matter was pushed away from the event horizon at unfathomable speeds. The outward expansion is why the matter didn't fall back on itself from gravity and form a black hole. Energy converted to matter in an instant and formed every single atom in existence.

	64218 : ["This is how courts of the grim Catholic Inquisition were often described. The terrifying charge brought against the hapless defendants was heresy, a word that conjures up pictures of torture and execution by burning at the stake.  It was a special ecclesiastical tribunal instituted to stamp out heresy, that is, opinions or doctrines out of line with orthodox Roman Catholic teaching. Catholic sources state that it was instituted in stages. Pope Lucius III established the Inquisition at the Council of Verona in 1184.  And its organization and procedures were perfected if such a word can be used to describe that fearsome institution by other popes. In the 13th century, Pope Gregory IX established inquisitorial tribunals in various parts of Europe. The infamous Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478 with a papal bull issued by Pope Sixtus IV at the request of ruling sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella.  In 1542, Pope Paul III instituted the Roman Inquisition, which had jurisdiction over the whole Catholic world.  He appointed a central tribunal of six cardinals, called the Congregation of the Holy Roman and Universal Inquisition, an ecclesiastical body that became a government of terror that filled the whole of Rome with fear.   The execution of heretics terrorized those lands where the Catholic hierarchy held sway.", 8241, "AA10260693", 2],
