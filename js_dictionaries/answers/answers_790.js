Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 6333, "None", 0],

Their natural habitat is theathened, they wander down to villages to scavenge for food. I'm not a zoologist, so IDK how many will all adapt but some will, and this shall cause major problems for villages around the arctic circle. Anyone can google and see that more and more have been seen in villages in northern Russia in recent years. Why do they do that? They can't hunt for sea creatures anymore.  @graphicconception, I'm glad that you are still alive and in good health. And despite what you say about COVID, I hope you get inoculated. I'm going to as soon as I can. We had problems with shipments of Pfizer with the EU, but they are coming in again. Also I think hydroxychloroquin is still used, but as last resort. But prevention is better than cure. I agree with you that Einstein and Newton din't need peer review, pegminer left a comment about Edmun Halley, but still, did he really need to pass peer review to be correct? No, but I guess it helped his work get published. Peer review has it's flaws, especially in ''modern theoretical physics'' but it does not mean it should be regarded as ''all'' flawed, and you know that... Anyhow, I wish you well GC to you and all your loved ones, and I hope you all get trough this pandemic safe and intact.xx The Clown is funny, the harder he tries the more ridiculous he sounds.

	43891 : ["Peer review is overrated. Newton and Einstein did lots of good work with no peer reviewer involved at all. In many cases it is used to exert political control over the sciece. If you have a paper that is not supportive of \"the narrative\" then you will have a lot of trouble both getting your paper accepted by a journal and of getting it past peer review. Journal editors even conspire with approved scientists to rubbish certain papers. One climatepaper was held up by the journal until the approved scientists had managed to rebut it. It took months to concoct the sceond paper but they were published in successive editions of the journal making it look like the rebuttal was obvious and required no thought at all. Another editor held up a paper so that a rebuttal could be placed in the same edition of the journal. That was clever because that would not count as a rebuttal. The original scientists could query the second paper but the second group of scientists would then have the last word. Effectively, the first group of scientists were denied the usual right of having the last word by that mechanism. We also heard recently about how bad hydroxychloroquine was in the fight against COVID-19. The Lancet, a formerly prestigious UK medical journal, published a hastily put together, peer reviewed paper saying how bad hydroxuchloroquine was. They later had to retract the paper because it was not true but the politicians needed to play down any treatment for COVID-19 because if there was a treatment then there would be no emergency vaccine and Bill Gates's chances of making $200 billion from a vaccine would evaporate. See how it really works? Polar bear poplations are interesting. They are used an emotive icon of Global Warming without much evidence either way. We have data for only about half the area used by the bears and there does not seem to be a huge push to decide the situation one way or the other. Even with polar bears the establishment cheats. Remember when the world's leading polar bear expert was not allowed to speak at one of the climate conferences? He was replaced with a more on-message speaker.", 6336, "BkdgZozJaa", 12],
