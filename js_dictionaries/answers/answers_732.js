Leafing through the published papers of others who have actually done so, then claiming those papers say something the authors themselves deny, is neither \"scholarly\" nor \"authoritative.\" --- @anonymous - Her dissertation was titled \"Animal Domestication and Vertebrate Speciation: A Paradigm for the Origin of Species\".Â Â  It had nothing to do with \"Polar bear thyroid and digestion.\" The paper she wrote on that topic was something she wrote in grad school and wasn't remotely a \"dissertation.\"", 5977, "tsgP2JfBaa", -8],

	40835 : ["Its a smear tactic. Libs cant debate actual science so they have to attack the progenitors of the open debate. . They use that term to shift the dividing line. The real line is \"alarmist\", people who swallow the catastrophic claim as well as the \"solution\" which is always the same (more government control less freedom for you and as a side effect more money n the politicians pockets)....and \"realist\" who has noticed the climate getting warmer overall but nothing out of line with the past. We saw the warming shift during the 80s and 90s. Also have many references including the UNIPCC chief Pachauri admitting to \"the pause\" which followed. Also one can BING the phrase \"coming ice age\" and see archived many articles from the 70s. I saved links to the 2 newsweek articles, one during the ice age scare and later trying to explain away that first article. Funny as he((. . The alarmists are also preparing just in case the planet doesnt burn up to blame the next cooling phase (if they cant cover it up) on American made GW. Have you seen the movies blaming AGW for a sudden massive ice age? Like \"Day After Tomorrow\"? Now a TV series , stupid show about a train having to keep going to keep everyone from freezing (also caused by American made GW). . And we have bit like this. This just one example (The JPG below) **** Look at this jewel from anonymous (obvious leftie). \".... In this context a denier is some one who rejects that human emissions of CO2 leads to earth retaining more of the sun's energy.Â  (It would be wrong to label some one a denier who accepts that man made global warning is a fact, but wants to leave it to subsequent generations to deal with it.)....\" Easy to spot the flaw in it. It is only accurate if the so called \"science\" is settled. In reality alarmists keep putting up \"facts\" which are debunqued easily, like the 97% claim and the government \"data which fake D always uses in spite of my references to numerous studies which he doesnt even deny just says \"it doesnt matter cause Hansen, and Mann...etc always adjust the data\". btw A lot more examples abound not just those 2......... *****", 5978, "zbdlJsqfaa", -1],

	40838 : ["If you view both subject areas through the political lens you see that they are both part of the same plan. They are both ideas that need a global response. For a global response you need a global organisation. That is what our real lords and masters are after. They want to have a one-world government with them pulling the strings, obviously. It is very tedious to have to blackmail around 200 national governments. Much better to install a single New World Order system. If we assume that both events just happened naturally then you might not agree with that idea. However, if you read between the lines and see how science has been subverted by the politicians and how both topics were hyped by the media then you start to see parallels.", 5979, "BkdgZozJaa", 1],

	40845 : ["Not \"some\" just those who ironically also worship big government. Not a coincidence that the dividing line for AGW falls very closely along liberal / conservative line and libs always siding with big government socialists. Same libs who think Democats care about the poor and are working tirelessly to make your lives better also swallow these, clearly gov. schemes. Notice most scientists who speak up in disagreement have little or no dependence on government. Like Roger Revelle who changed sides after he retired. They have a video on Heartland about Gores response to Revelles switch. It is not pretty. . They debunque the gov. claims regularly. Wildfires dropped dramatically as forest management (culling deadwood and such) were implement and logging was used to control undergrowth. A slight uptick in the destruction can be seen coinciding with liberals curtailing our efforts to manage forests. Like NAFTA which moved much of our logging industry to Canada, i am sure they appreciated Americans sacrifice for them. .", 5973, "zbdlJsqfaa", 0],

But if you disagree with homosexuality then it wouldn't be right to pretend that you are accepting when you really aren't. What are you going to do if you find out? You can't change his orientation: conversion therapy has been shown not to work. But there are other possibilities. He may have been so hurt by this one girlfriend that he isn't ready to date yet. Or he might find it difficult to attract women, and just lucked out on getting a girlfriend on one occasion.
