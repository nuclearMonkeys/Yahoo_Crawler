	77099 : ["Deal with the troll before it's too late. Every question in th.answers.yahoo.com has tons of blank answers (using space bar); it could have been posted by someone like Shadowfire to gain points for his troll accounts. In his questions and answers he always refers to Christian Lord God as “lord” / “god”; basically, when using proper grammar throughout his hateful blasphemous speech, he deliberately writes these two words from lower case letter. Jewish user Shadowfire (who spams this link “deathmetal.org/news/christ-sodomized” and has been on Yahoo Answers since the beginning and could possibly be the infamous homosexual flying antichrist from the tribe of Dan) from Portland [or so he claims because he could've been born in Russia in Valday (Russian: Валда́й) to a 12th generation Jewish prostitute who pretends to be a virgin)] has many trolls accounts on Yahoo Answers. These could be his accounts: Blackthorne1979, James Blackthorne, ✟ summer of night omega crow † ⚔, Saint James Tiberius Troll, Lord Shadowfire, Carter Berg, Madam Sin Bin, Fireball, Aravah, Miguel, ThatToiletguy, Tublet Huglet, Tut Uncommon: 3peat Offender, Cult Free, Reynaldo Weeks, Juli, Petri Lindroos, Uncle Fester, Lord Ninigi, Knightwulf, Nonplussed, Nightwulf, lyconpolis (lycon = wolf), Derick Fields, Toilet John, Hitler Was Right About The Jews, Master Debator, Magistra, Desiree, D-girl, Firecock, Yahoo User, Corvus Blackthorne, Patrick McCluskey,  Lord Aizen, Torchbug, Arni, r.wolfpaw, No Bozos, Fuzzface McGee, First Dragon, L.E. Gant, Fullofpoop, Shadowfire the Sarcastic, Pope of Atheist God, Jimson C. Raskin,   A yellow face with simple open eyes showing clenched teeth, El Nerdo Loco, megalomaniac, Corvia Blackthorne, Shadowfire Lives, Shadowfire Lives bytches, The Chick that wears Doc Martens, Homo, Wotan 8, Wotan (who keeps posting “satanisgod.org”), Heidi Ho, Clo Bird, Angels with Silver Wings, Orange I'lluminaughty, Christian Sinner, Gandalf the black, The Lord Hummungus, Mismatched Tube Socks, Pearl, Partysnax the Dragon, etc. and any other anonymous accounts. With one his accounts Fireball, he pretends to be a Methodist old lady who posts short-hand slang TIRH (this is religion here). He reports all answers and questions that he doesn't like just so that his questions stay on top in the Religion and Spirituality section. He trolls in other categories too. It gives Christians a bad name (just because of this troll's sock puppet account). His Toilet John account keeps posting questions where Jesus was sodomized by Roman soldiers. Remember the prophecy where it says that the antichrist will have personal hatred towards the real Jesus Christ. That's why Shadowfire keeps posting thousands of similar questions along the line: “Did Romans sodomize Jesus?” or “Was Jesus anally violated during the crucifixion?” or \"How many liters of cûm did Jesus swallow before being hanged on the cross to die?\" or \"Did Jesus take a big dick up the butt beforr dying?\" or \"Did Roman buttfck Jesus before crucifying him?\" or “Did Romans buttrape Jesus?”. He asks multiple idiotic mundane questions like “Is Hinduism true?”, “What makes a girl harden?” [like he enjoyed killing little girls], etc. and answers them with his sock puppet accounts just to gain points. Some questions you can see that he answered with like five or seven accounts (especially the ones about himself that he reports right away). With his Reynaldo Weeks account he boasts that he was the reason why their accounts were suspended. With his Magistra account he threatens people with clowns and CIA assassins. Shadowfire mocks Christians with his sock puppet account Fireball in the Religion and Spirituality section by answering very destructively and adding \"TIRH here\" or reported (anonymously) or “fck you nigers”. He gives Christians a bad name because he promotes sins like sodomy, fornication, ecumenism, astrology (horoscopes), etc. He should be executed and burned at the stake for blasphemy. He spreads rapture heresy, reincarnation heresy, ecumenism heresy, etc. and many more subtle heresies. Antichrist will ride on a donkey into the 3rd Temple. Stop him before it's too late. Antichrist is gay flying wizard who was born from a prostitute and who will ride on a donkey into the 3rd Temple. Antichrist's mother is a 12th generation prostitute (according to saint Lavrentiy of Chernigov). According to researcher Grigoriy Klimov, prostitutes = lesbians = witches; so, antichrist's mother is a witch, a lesbian, and a prostitute. Hide your kids, hide your wife ‘cuz de evil antichrist is flying thru town; take your glocks out and shoot dat son of a bytch down! Again, he's an s-o-b ‘cuz his mother is a prostitute to Jews and Hindus. Funny thing is that she pretends to be a virgin. Don't be deceived by this skumbag and his fake miracles trying to emulate Christ's miracles! If wrongfully accused, forgive me; state under your account that you are not Corvus Blackthorne then. Shadowfire claims to be extraterrestrial raven when demons pretend to be extraterrestrials. I'm paranoid and think that all Yahoo accounts that talk about ravens are about him. Please, help me; I beg you. Using user Miguel, he's teaching people how to summon demons. Dirty, very dirty! Shadowfire is a true dirtbag; do something to stop him now; he's only one user and he's doing the harm like it's hundreds of users.", 8878, "None", 0],

We have a large family 12 children from the same mother and father.  Most of them are Catholic.  At the Catholic, DeLa sal School the Catholic teachers are so nice and sacrificing.  I believe the Catholics do love the Lord. BUT!!!   They say the Rosary to Mary all the time they believe that the bread and wine actually turn into the body and blood of Christ and they use beads, statues, and other objects to worship with.  All this is against God's word found in scripture.  Then when I sit and visit with my father or the priest or other Catholics I see the fruit of their lips and I see gossip, cursing, foul language, sexual oriented and demeaning language, hate for others and so much more.  This is not the fruits I exhibit in my life.  The Spirit of God teaches us that these things are wrong.  The objects and Rosary and statues and the wicked fruit it is all wrong and the Lord himself tells us that a Good tree brings forth Good fruit and can not bring forth evil fruit.

	77135 : ["Maybe there is something there that might be 'embarassing' I mean, based on past history. Bill Clinton did not earn only $35,000 as Governor. His expenses were often paid out of various state funds, including a $51,000 \"food allowance\" and a $19,000 \"public relations\" fund, never claimed as income.  Hillary Clinton's aggressive tax deductions, included $1,000 to more than $2,300 a year for used clothing donations. Hillary annually gave bags of used clothes to Goodwill and the Salvation Army. Taking time from her arduous schedule, she personally catalogued each piece and its value, such as $10 each pair for Bill's old running shoes, $3 for Bill's used undershirts and $1 a pair for Bill and Chelsea's underwear. Despite Bill Clinton's siding with \"those who work hard and play by the rules,\" While the President threw nominees overboard for not paying taxes on nannies, the Clintons never paid taxes in 1980 on their state-funded nanny, Dessie Sanders. In 1981 and 1982, when Clinton was out of office, they claimed a child care exemption for Sanders' services, but still didn't pay any Social Security taxes for her. A 1981 audit showed that Chelsea's nanny, Dessie Sanders, was employed at the governors' mansion from the time of Chelsea's birth to the time Clinton left office. The State of Arkansas does not pay for nannies, so Governor Clinton had Dessie Sanders listed on the payroll as a security guard. Helen Dickey (also known as 'a white house aide', a title that put her on the government payroll) was one of Chelsea's nannies in the white house but Becky Brown and Dessie Sanders raised Chelsea for the biggest part of her life. Becky Brown was on the payroll as an 'assistant administrator' in the governor's mansion. In reality, she was Chelsea Clinton's nanny, but the formal title meant that her salary could be paid by the state, thus landing the taxpayers of Arkansas with the financial liability for bringing up Chelsea. The Clintons even managed to claim tax relief for the statefunded nanny. The Clintons also have a history of what they call \"oversights\" when it comes to their taxes. One example: In 1994 The Clintons paid the Internal Revenue Service and the Arkansas state government $14,615 in back taxes and interest, after failing to report profits from a commodities-trading venture to the IRS. They said it was simply a mistake, an \"oversight\". If you want links, there are 13,300 to choose from here: For the verification on the nannies, just google their names plus words like 'nanny', 'Clinton', 'Chelsea', 'tax', etcetera. How greedy and trashy can a person get?  They had more than enough money to raise one child, but they made taxpayers pay for raising Chelsea. Then they claimed tax relief for it in addition to that. And deducting for used underwear? Who else would DO that? Even if it wasn't ALL fraud, it's still just so....wrong. They called Paula Jones \"trash\". But, I bet Jones doesn't deduct income tax for used underwear. I have never heard of anything like that before. OH, here's over 600 links for their \"oversight\" too:", 8870, "jX3evhC3aa", 6],
