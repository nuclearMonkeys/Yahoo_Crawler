Anyways at the original question. If you watch any interview Peyton does and when Eli is brought up he always gives the same response. He is overprotective of Eli, he gives advice to Eli, he is much closer to Eli then to Cooper. You have to see his body movement and his face and he always smiles when it comes to Eli. Its nothing but the truth. Also Eli got out out of his brother's shadow the moment he won the superbowl", 10981, "1CunumQKaa", -1],

But where secular law and religious law conflict, then there is a conflict between morals and ethics. For example, consensual prostitution is ethical (two consenting adults making a business deal), but it is immoral (fornication, extra-marital sex). On the flip side, hiring people exclusively from your church may be moral (help your brother, love your neighbor) but might be unethical (violates local Equal Opportunity laws).

	128442 : ["I suppose the only difference between ethics and morality relies solely upon ones definition of either. Ethics and morality are both a code of conduct in which one distinguishes between right and wrong. When one applies a different set ethics to the variant aspects of his life, then some differences may arise; e.g. one may be an ethical doctor, but an immoral catholic or one may live a moral life by any given set of ethics and be an entirely unethical journalist who slants the facts for his own moral agenda.  In addition to that there are many different cultures in the world with many different codes of conduct, or ethics/morals. When these cultures cross paths, there are bound to be judgements made between them that stem from these differences of ethics. This is where the philosophy of ethics, rational morality perhaps, comes into play and acts as a bridge between cultures, that being a way of living in which one utilizes his ethics to care for himself and extends those ethics to others within his society whom extend the same ethics to him for the benefit of the greater good. I do not aim to suggest that this concept of a bridge based on philosophy is entirely foolproof, as some chasms between the ethics of various cultures may be vast. I suppose that this is why we, as a species, choose to put laws into place to uphold the ethics, or code of conduct, of the majority in some cases; or of the powerful few in other cases. Without these laws, which are in essence a set of ethics, man tends to result to utter chaos and survival of the most heavily armed.  I will have to agree to disagree on the notion that ethics be a strictly man made concept. Familial ethics are riddled within the behavior of numerous species through out the animal kingdom, both within immediate procreant groups and as well within creatures that roam in packs. Porpoises have been known to come together to drive away sharks from their prey and as well, alpha wolves tend to uphold order within the pack.

Basically, a man or a woman who do not want a permanent marriage, but want to have sex to relieve themselves- they do Muta (temporary marriage) then break it off once they get what they want. That is unIslamic. Marriage is a sacred thing in Islam, and it shouldn't be used as a tool or a pass for sex. Marriage should be permanent, and should be based on loyalty and commitment.  Sunni's don't accept Muta'h and neither does Islam. There is no basis in it for that. misyar isFor one if a woman becomes pregnant then what? What if the husband is married and hence why can't a married woman to Misyar. What about the protection for wife. What about the sanctity of marriage. The most important again it is merely a way around Zina, so if Muta is Haram how can this be. Temporary marriages are Haram and should be, just b/c Saudis advocate it does not make it legit. It is Haram and should be condemned, no self respecting man or woman should get involved in this.  Would you let your wife into a Misyar, your daughter? Is is Haram as it breaks the conditions and the sanctity of marriage. The primary reason is sexual gratification. Staff of Moses Muta MUST exist in your fantasies or Parallel universe, or maybe you have a special version of Qur'an.  \"4.24\": And all married women except those whom your right hands possess (this is) Allah's ordinance to you, and lawful for you are (all women) besides those, provided that you seek (them) with your property, taking (them) in marriage not committing fornication.

	128466 : ["Ideas for baskets:  Use baskets that you already have or get plain straw baskets that can be re-used over and over.  Use buckets; small buckets that can be used for storage in the kid's room, or beach buckets that they can play with all summer long. Use paper shopping bags with handles. You can paint over logos on shopping bags or use plain paper bags with handles. Grass for baskets: I don't always use the 'grass'. Just a basket or bucket without grass looks just fine and is less messy. Using the shredded paper from work is great. You can also shred colorful pages from magazines. Use straw or yarn to make a nest in the bottom of the basket or bucket instead of grass. Use left over tissue paper to line the bottom of baskets or buckets; check to see if you have any green tissue leftover from  . The Hunt: Instead of having all the kids rush to grab up the treats, try hiding treats for each child and give each child a list of clues to find their treats. Hide each basket with a few treats, and then hide a few more treats for each child. Adults or older kids can read the clues for kids to young to read. Another way to do this is to make up the basket, bag, or bucket for each child; and hide it. Then create a list of clues that will lead each child to his or her basket. Ideas for Treats: Plastic easter eggs are ok, but I limit the number of these that I use; I only use them for very small items like jelly beans.  Chocolate eggs, chocolate bunnies, snack sized packets of Easter Candy like M&Ms or Skittles Sidewalk Chalk: some craft stores carry egg shaped chalk. You could also get a bucket of chalk and put a few colors in a small bag for each child. Once the hunt is over, have the kids decorate your sidewalk, driveway, patio, or porch with Easter bunnies, flowers, ducks, or anything they like. Balls: the Nerf footballs are shaped like an egg; and they are fun to play with. Other small balls are fun too. Playdough: you can make your own playdough or buy playdough. Have some cookie cutters available and have the kids make bunnies or other figures. Bubbles: make your own or buy some. The kids can play with the bubbles after the hunt. Small books of scripture based Easter stories or coloring books with crayons. Or you could print off some Bible pictures to color. Packets of seeds tied to a small shovel; or a small plant for them to take home and care for. Have fun!", 10982, "SfGyzMSFaa", 2],
