	124987 : ["When I was a Jehovah's Witness (up until the mid 1970's), we neither prayed to Jesus, called upon the name of Jesus, invoked the name of Jesus or made any appeal to Jesus.  That is because Jehovah's Witnesses believe that prayer (which is a form of worship) must go only to Jehovah.  Jehovah is God and Jesus is the Son, a created being - Michael the archangel.  Jesus is \"a god\" whilst Jehovah is \"God.\" If they are right, and Jesus is a created \"god,\" then it would be utterly wrong to pray to Jesus.  That would be polytheism.  So why did Thomas cry out \"The God of me and the Lord of me\"?  Why did Jesus accept worship before he ascended?  And what was Jesus doing, moments before he died, when he cried out, \"Father, into your hand I commit my spirit\"?  Was that not a prayer?  Because if that was not a prayer, then perhaps there is a case for suggesting that when Stephen cried out \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit\" he wasn't praying. But I think we're nit-picking here.  Jesus prayed to his Father in heaven to receive his spirit.  Stephen, who saw the glory of God and Jesus in heaven, prayed to Jesus to receive his spirit.  But Jehovah's Witnesses still think Jesus is merely a created archangel, Michael.  They are no more likely to pray to him than they are to bend their knees and worship him when he returns in power and glory, with all the angels (including Michael the archangel).  No, they have relegated Jesus to a created archangel, a little god.  They would no more pray to Jesus than they would disagree with the Governing Body.  Unfortunately, the Governing Body are in no position to save them.", 10819, "None", 2],
	124988 : ["The context shows that Jesus was in view when Stephen said this, so it's not really a prayer, is it? Interestingly, the word in question is *not* the Greek word for prayer, although it *can* be a prayer if the context indicates that it is. But in and of itself the word does not mean \"prayer.\" Regardless, the context shows that it's not prayer. The Greek word for \"prayer\" is proseukhomai. But the word here is epikaleo, which literally means \"call upon.\" Basically it means to call on a higher authority, of which Jesus certainly is. But it doesn't necessarily mean that Jesus is God, nor that Stephen is praying. The Emphatic Diaglott can be dismissed as evidence since it's not a JW production. JWs have printed many Bible translations, most of them done by Trinitarians. The footnote in the NWT is evidence against your claim that the NWT is averse to using the word \"prayer,\" since if they were they wouldn't have put it in the footnote. Think about it. I think it shows the honesty of the NWT translators - something that is lacking in many Trinitarian translations. Your claim that most translations say \"prayer\" in this verse is false. From what I see most say \"call upon\" or something similar.", 10819, "Xt9wIj4Iaa", 5],

Bottom line - unless the order is illegal, there is no conflict between an order from anyone in your command and what is prescribed in the US constitution.  For example, the Constituion says you have the right to free speech, freedom of assembly, etc.  However, your leaders can tell you to at ease (or shut the hell up), they can place restrictions on you (off-limits establishments are an example) The way you write the question leads me to believe you are hiding something, looking for very generic answers to support whatever it is you are looking for.
