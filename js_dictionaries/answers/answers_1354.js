These are best if you like them and will use them often after the class. Get an amateur model if it's only for the class. Pentax K1000 is the classic example. The famous spotmatic. Canon AE1, Nikon FE, etc. I don't recommend you to buy a new FM10 or the vivitar model. Older models can be obtained at a similar or lower price and are tougher, in my opinion. The fact of having lenses that you can carry over for use in you DSLR aren't important, in my opinion, because you'll end preferring the AF lenses that are availiable.
