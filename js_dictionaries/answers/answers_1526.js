That takes a lot of hard work, effort, discipline, and focus on your part. You mention that your friend has dropped out of school and lives off of her mother. Nothing has turned up on her life as far as dreams or goals... until this one person showed interest in her \"talent\". Your jealousy stems from the possibility that this may be her big break and all she had to do was show up to an audition. Well, I would be too if I were in your shoes. But the sad truth is that for your friend to make it big on this one ticket is a LONG SHOT. Super star fairy tales are one in a million!!! For every famous Hollywood super star there are millions of other people. They are lawyers, teachers, doctors, construction workers, men, women, children, rich, poor, homeless, etc. I doubt your friend will make it to the big time if she has a history of not working hard. And just because one person showed interest doesn't mean anything. On top of that, you should be glad she has a friend like you. Don't stomp on her dreams but be sure that she has someone with her or knows where she is or going during and after these auditions. It is no new thing that some people tale advantage of the dreams and naivety of people like your friend. Anyway, only time will tell what will become of your friend and her acting career. he best you can do is listen and support her dreams. She is your friend and hopefully would do the same for you.

First of all - as long as you work really hard at it, you are very likely to succeed in medical school, particularly considering your track record.  Within 8 years, you will be making 200k a year or more.  Within 15, you could easily be making half a million a year, reliably.    Your friend on the other hand, has gotten a POSSIBLE bit part in a movie.  Do you know how far she's going to have to go before this could even turn into a few bucks?   Do you know the real odds against her and how many other people are doing the same thing and want it just as badly as she does?   Do you realize how many people have been the leading role who just getting by?  Go to blockbuster and take a hard look at all the crappy b movies and ask yourself - how much do you think they paid someone with a bit part?   You say she's accomplished little else.  What do you want her to do for the rest of her uneducated and untalented life?  Pluck chickens?      It's good that you recognize this feeling of yours as inappropriate, but you are very right.  It's not just inappropriate, it's downright ugly.     Think of it this way - how has your success and dreams made her feel about herself for the last few years?  Does she act happy for you in your academic achievements and goals for medical school while she contemplates a life of jobs greeting people at wally world or being a gradeschool lunch line lady?     The solution to changing your feelings is to see the big picture.  Put yourself in your friends shoes.  See her future as she sees it.    Also - right now she's having dreams, even if she is getting ahead of herself.  Please let her have these dreams.  Dreams drive motivation and fuel action.  Without them, she really doesn't have anything.  Your jealousy is based on nothing but her dreams - not her current reality.  If you really are that jealous - change your dreams.  Drop medical school and go to hollywood and grind it out going to zillions of auditions while you wait tables like about 10,000 other young gals.   - Kevin", 9092, "AA10541300", 0],

	82000 : ["Let's take a look at the key parts of that article: \"...the curriculum does not deal with health or sex education. “If a student responds that one family in the book is made up of a mother, a father, and two children and a cat, you may acknowledge that some families look like this, but ask students for other examples of what a family can look like.” School Board Member Trish Spencer, who voted against the plan, said she worries that its implementation could lead to the harassment of students who have religious objections to homosexuality. She cited that bullying due to religion is a bigger problem for the district than bullying based on homosexuality.\" So let me get this straight.  This isn't health or sex education.  It's simply pointing out to students that there are different types of American family units - which is absolutely true.  And because of that horrifying revelation now the old guard against even acknowledging that homosexual families exist in their communities is going to try and claim that it's somehow may lead to students bullying their classmates who are...religious?  Please.    And to top it all off you are trying to morph this into some kind of a connection to how poor Sarah Palin, and Hillary Clinton, was treated.  What?!!??  Sarah Palin invited everything that was said about her by the words that came out of her own mouth and her lack of basic knowledge about her own country and the world at large.  I don't know if we have ever had a VP candidate so ill-suited to be a heartbeat away.  And Hillary Clinton, as one of your answerers already pointed out made the ultimate mistake of assuming she had things wrapped up early.  I'm a big Hillary fan, but she screwed up doing that.  There was sexism involved big time as well, but it has zero to do with whether to teach our children the reality of the diverse American family fabric in this country. Gays and lesbians do love and respect straight people.  Their families, co-workers, and plenty of friends are straight people.  But there is no reason they should have to love and respect heterosexuals who still seek to keep them on the lower rung of society because of bigoted attitudes.
