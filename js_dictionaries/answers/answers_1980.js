	104750 : ["Religion:-  Religion is a system of beliefs and worships which includes a code of ethics and a philosophy of life.  There are many religions in the world today. Some of these religions are of recent origin but most of them are very old. In fact we know from history that man has always had a religion. Even the primitive men living in caves or jungles had some sort of religion. The concepts and rituals in man's religion have CONTINUALLY evolved and become more rational and sophisticated as time went on. The primitive religions of the Cave Man and the Bush Man gave rise to the modern religions of the past three thousand years.  Today, the major religions of the world include:  World Religion ----- Originated in  Zoroastrianism ----- Iran  Confucianism ----- China  Hinduism ------ India  Taoism ------ China  Jainism ------ India  Judaism ------ Neat East  Christianity ------ Near East  Islam ------ Near East  Buddhism ------- India  Shinto ------- Japan  These are the great religions of the world which are not only responsible for all our accumulated wealth of wisdom, philosophy, ethics, and social and moral codes, but have influenced the culture, the language and the moral attitudes of almost every PERSON living today.  Difference between Religious and Non Religious Peoples.  1. The religious people believe in something while the others do not.  2. The religious people perform certain acts of worship while the others do not.  3. The religious people seem to follow a certain code for their social and moral behaviour while the others do not.  4. The religious people find a purpose of life and have a definite philosophy towards it, while the others do not.", 9892, "xJEdlIJKaa", 0],
	104751 : ["\"How many other things do you believe in which you can't see or has been constructed by men? \" - Well, if you're talking about Idols, as in people are worshiping something that they have constructed themselves, then i also believe that this is wrong and should not be done because god has created everything and has also created stone which people are making idols out of - so a god is being created. Also, you get people who worship the sun, the stars and all sorts, but these are also a creation of god. If you're talking about it as though you believe that there is no god, well then how did the world come about - well you might say the big bang - but you said how could you believe in things that your haven't seen - Muslims have proof as it is mentioned in the quran - but what proof do people have that a \"big bang\" took place and that's how the world came about. Also, look at the rivers, the mountains, the sky and how it is in place and isn't falling ( due to gravity)- all of these are clear signs to show that someone very great has created this and no one besides god has the ability to do so. How could you say there's no god (by saying there's no religon) even after everything you have been given - I mean you've been given a laptop or computer, that's how you asked this question - who else could have given you this or created a human and his brain to make him make this laptop or computer for you besides god.", 9892, "6Q3A9POEaa", 0],

Also, you might lose metadata (like album cover art, song name, etc). And, iTunes likes to keep a backup of your i-product, which can occupy several gigabytes of data.

The oldest recorded books in history are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.  From these books as well as many others from the Bible, we get words like \"Righteous\" which is where the word \"Good\" comes from, which is used to describe much of the difference between what is morally right and morally wrong.

Uninstall unneeded programs (especially those that run at startup and/or put something in the system tray), run Disk Cleanup, and defragment the drive.

Click Start > Run and type \"msconfig\" at the prompt. Click the Startup tab and look at all that junk that loads when you launch your PC. Do you really need \"Adobe Reader Speed Launch\"? Probably not. Turn off anything else that looks useless, but be careful not to disable your anti-virus and important system components. 3) Run a full anti-virus and anti-spyware scan. I would recommend using AVG Free Anti-virus, Spybot - Search and Destroy spyware remover and Ad-aware spyware remover. These programs are all free. 4) Clean up the registry.

I used to work on cars as a summer job and I did see some sunfires with the 3.1L in them but they where all 3 speeds. But anyway I wouldn't worry about it the 3.1L is a very dependable little engine the only real problems are the coil packs and the ICM going bad but they only go bad if the engine is very dirty. and even if the coil packs or the ICM go bad its still cheap enough to replace. The 3.1L either cam with the 3 speed auto or the five speed manual in later years you could also get it with the 4 speed auto. The way that you can tell a four cylinder sunfire from a six cylinder is by looking at the muffler the V6 sunfires have two exhaust pipes coming out of the muffler and the four cylinder sunfires have a single out let.
