Here is a short version of the problem with fossils, I am not a creationist but just want to share the problem with the fossil record.  Cambrian Explosion â€“ Summary In summary, what is generally proposed, is the extraordinary coincidence that these diverse types of organism with their radically different skeletons all reached fossilizable stage within a relatively short period of time. The Cambrian explosion raises the kinds of questions that occur repeatedly regarding the fossil record. First is that major new types of organism appear suddenly and abruptly. Second, many different lines, exhibiting the same sort of significant development, arise about the same time. There exists such a radical diversity that it becomes implausible that they shared a recent common ancestor. It also seems unrealistic that the same sort of advance could have arisen independently in several lines, especially simultaneously.", 11537, "hcO4YsVHaa", -1],

Kimberlite pipes are the outcome of explosive diatreme volcanism from very deep mantle derived resources. those volcanic explosions produce vertical columns of rock that upward push from deep magma reservoirs. The morphology of kimberlite pipes are diverse yet commonly comprise a sheeted dyke complicated of tabular, vertically dipping feeder dykes contained in the muse of the pipe which enlarge right down to the mantle. interior of a million.5-2 km of the exterior the fantastically forced magma explodes upwards and expands to form a conical to cylindrical diatreme, which erupts to floor. the exterior expression isn't preserved yet is oftentimes equivalent to a maar volcano.
