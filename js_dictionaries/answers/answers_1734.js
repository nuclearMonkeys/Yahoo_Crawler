Note, I did not say the day you paid, even if you did a payment by phone or online payment, it does not post immediately so you can still get interest charges.  If you call up & complain about it, they may clear it but you may have to threaten to close the account & blog about them doing it before they will, you may also have to demand to speak to a supervisor to get them to believe you are serious.", 9446, "DfIEgDbAaa", 1],

Communication as well to. I needed the attention and the emotional connection with a guy as well to. My guy was not providing me with that. He knew he was not providing me with that to. Now guys on the other hand are going to cheat for different reasons. Usually they need attention as well. Lack of sex is another reason. Bored of sex with one person is another reason why they cheat they want variety!And if the guy is a player cause all players do is cheat! How cheating starts is getting an open communication with a male or female. Then usually a emotional connection starts. Then from there usually it leads to sex.  So what i advise is to always keep an open communication with your man. Have sex with him a few times per week. Don't forget the bj's to cause well....he could find someone to give them to him to if u don't perform them correctly or good enough!Keep the house clean and take of the kids or work which ever!And don't be to jealous either cause most guys don't like jealous girls!And another thing most guys are going to look at porn if they say they do it or not!", 9444, "None", 0],

	92413 : ["I know this is 6 years old, but I really don't enjoy reading so much poorly defined information. So I want to give some pointers to other people that come by this post. There is no such thing as a bulk/cut phase. What I mean by this is, yes you will pack on a lot of mass, but you will look bloated and never reach where you want to be. You loose too much muscle when cutting. It only works when you juice... testosterone etc. Go hybrid lean muscle gaining in stead. By this I mean, work out with i.e Elliot Hulse's program and follow dietary plans. By doing incorporated cardio (preferably H.I.I.T) and progressively gaining weight at a steady pace you can stay lean all year around while putting on muscles. You just have to fast a day or two a week, and know how to utilise your body to its fullest. How? By learning about insulin spikes, testosterone, anabolic, catabolic and all the mechanics that your body has in order to gain or loose muscles. Once you know the science behind it you can start to figure out the rest on your own.  Also, people who say you hinder weight gain with cardio are wrong. You just can't run 40 minutes+. By doing a quick 5-10 min HIIT cardio run then you'll yield 10% more results when it comes to lifting as your body transfers more oxygen in the blood.  Now, to the main thing. People don't realise you have to EAT to gain weight. And by eating I don't mean... ye I ate 5 times a day. I mean 5 BIG meals minimum. As you grow bigger you need more. Vincent Del Monte has a great pdf book that explains everything in a simple manner, and gives you the calculations to figure out how much to eat at any stage of your workout. Give it a read if you are serious about gaining weights. Keep a food diary. Keep a workout diary. Measure your body parts and keep it in a diary. How can you know you have or have not progressed, if you haven't bothered to take the few minutes at the end of the weak to measure?  So thats it folks! I'm by no means an expert, and have only pieced together information over time. Check out channels like Elliot Hulse, Omarlsuf, hodgemuscletwins etc on youtube for some good tips and talks :) Good luck!", 9440, "None", 0],

	92415 : ["Did you pay off your bill when it's due or do you borrow?  If you pay some, they will charge you interest on the remaining about.  Once you owe them money, the interest keeps adding up until you paid the principal about and the interest up til the date they receive the check.  ie.  January 1 - you charged $5000, you paid $2000 on Jan 20. Feb 1 - your bill will be $3000 plus interest from Jan 20 to Feb 1. If you still ddin't pay it, it will keep adding interest until you paid it off ALL. So, don't borrow unless you can manage it and the rate is lower than your saving's account. ie.  $5000 in the bank getting 1% Credit card debt at 5% You should pay the debt (5-1=4% extra) Also they are not tax deductible, you have to pay tax on your bank earnings.

To be muscular (and gain weight) you need to devote a lot of time to weights and adding more calories/protein to your diet.  The 2 goals seem mutually exclusive. It comes down to how much time you have to train, and how you spend that time when training.  I run to the gym (a good couple of miles) 2-4 times a week.  But in the gym I do nothing but weights, I avoid the cardio.  Additionally I'll do a longer run (somewhere between 5-8 miles) at some point in the week.  I think this is a good balance.
