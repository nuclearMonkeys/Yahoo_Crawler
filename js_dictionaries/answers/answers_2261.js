Are friendly to everyone 6. Don't bias friends on gender 7. Ethical 8. Flirtatious Maybe my school is a bit different... most of my friends go to church and are Christian. I wear a purity ring. But I like having fun. Flirting, having lots of friends, etc.... it's all part of having fun during the \"best years,\" is it not? But everywhere is different, obviously. I consider \"popularity\" being nice and having tons of friends. I have a lot of friends, and I have straight A's, am very religious, and I just like to have fun.

It is like two land masses collided\" - - - What? \"it is like two land masses collided\" -- That is exactly what happened .i.e the India plate is colliding into the Eurasian Plate, this is how mountain ranges are formed, or are you adding Plate Tectonics to the list of sciences you deny. @kdanley \"Is it okay to disagree in science\" --- absolutely yes \"or do the scientists act like priests and condemn those who disagree as heretics?\" --- No, but you will be laughed out of every centre of academia if you have no evidence to support your claim. It's OK that you have a different idea, but without evidence to support your idea it is pure supposition any nothing more, and to claim \"any geologist\" will tell you the Himalayas shouldn't be there is completely bogus.", 10554, "vv1cdDFZaa", 5],
	118847 : ["Maybe your calculations of rainfall are based on the wrong planet and surface area. Maybe the planet that was flooded and destroyed as the story goes was really detroyed. Mabe we were UPSed (G.O.D. Shipping is pretty good too) through outerspace.  So follow this: In Genesis there are two creation stories mixed together. One where man is created first and names the animals created later and one where the animals are created first and man followed. If G-d created two \"experiments\" on two planets and one experiment failed and the other experiment was restarted and that planet was completely destroyed by a flood (what is described is total annihilation of all life) could G-d take the remnants samples from one failed experiment and move it to the nearest M1 planet? The reason this occurs to me is first of all if we can do it, so could G-d. But some other things lead to this idea. Adam was on a planet that with all his work he could only grow thorns and thistles as the curse goes. With Noah the curse of Adam was lifted. The ark landed where olive trees grew of their own. Clearly the Ark landed somewhere very fertile. This would also explain dinosaurs not being mentioned. The planet that they moved to also had its own history and existing life forms. The Ark after all was finished by G-d.  Just an idea. Are there any planets nearby that have been inhabited by life and water and now have neither? Mars? Great floods? SO ARE YOU A MARTIAN. Even more so are there people here from other failed experimenst? Aliens? One big Petri dish. Hahahaha If you read abount the sons of gods and how they came down and took and had sex with the daughters of men creating men of renowm (super humans), then are the superior beings making a bar hopping adventure out of the universe? My point being, there are a thousand what ifs, to drive a truck through and push a scientific explanation. You just have to pay attention to find them. We do creationist things this very day? If we can genetically create things, then maybe evolution and creationism exists side by side. Maybe a creation of something that evolves is also a possibility.

They were the children of doctors, lawyers, the rich people 3. Football payers were as stupid as bricks and sometimes not the most popular. Being athletic (no matter the sport) made you more likely to become popular, something I never rightly understood. Another oddity was that many people in marching band were popular. i.e. they hardly feel under the nerdy, awkward stereotype.  4. You also described the popular students very well as that it was similar here too. ( fashionable, funny, slutty sometimes, they drink, do sexual stuff to get attention, skip class but get good grades). I always thought it was weird how many popular kids were athletic and on the A-honor roll. The cheese growing on trees thing is funny, but I believe that could happen.

(Genesis 6:11) Neither do we claim that the water covered Mt. Everest. Mt. Everest was not there. Talk to any geologist about that mountain. He will tell you that mountain range shouldn't be there. It is like two land masses collided. You need to study logic. You start with a false assumption and use that to laugh at us creationists. @Tomo Actually, I like geology.
