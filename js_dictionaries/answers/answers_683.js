	37973 : ["a) Most of the info you have provided is irrelevant. Just tell us the brand and model number of your amp so we can check the specs and tell you what the issue is.  b) Your terminology is incorrect. You do not \"bridge\" speakers, you bridge the channels of a multi-channel amplifier, if the amp supports bridging. What you do with speakers and voice coils is wire them in parallel or series configuration. c) My guess is that you've wired the subs in parallel for a 1 ohm total load, which your amp cannot handle. Try wiring the voice coils in series for 8 ohms, and then connect the subs in parallel for  4 ohm total impedance. .", 5625, "None", 1],

Was flown to San Francisco and then finally made its way down to southern Calif. I was looking at this every day, because I just couldn't believe it!
