I like so many others battled depression, substance abuse, I over compensated to the point my therapist told me I had over compensated on the over compensation. I can not say my typing speed increased but with the start of H.R.T. my thinking became much more clear and focused. I started to care about my psychical health and got my blood pressure under control. was able to give up a 2 pack a day addiction. Life became worth living.  I think that probably most of us if not all of us reach a point where it becomes transition or die. I can not imagine anyone really wanting to transition. We fight it until it becomes a crisis situation. Transition is scary, you know you will or could loose most everything you have spent a life time working for. You know you may loose all your friends, your family, job, home.  But you push on because the alternative is death. I chose to live and life meant transition. I am in the final days of this chapter of life. My second assessment is early next month, after it is done I will send the balance of the cost of surgery.

	141355 : ["as Paula asked, I too believe you are simply trying to justify what you read earlier by asking about sexual preferences. Here's one for you.. I'm intersexed.. I transitioned for medical/mental health reasons. I've always been more physically attracted towards men, but have never had a “real” relationship with one; in the relationships I have I'm basically A-Sexual – I'm attracted to the person for who they are rather than what sex they are. I don't consider myself as heterosexual, gay/lesbian or even bi-sexual I consider myself as Pansexual. Which is a sexual orientation that has been around long before Bailey, Blanchard & Lawrence's theories. Furthermore those individuals believe in reparative therapy which has long been disproven as reliable method. if they are allowed to continue in their beliefs anyone and everyone who maintains a deviation from what they consider as a “normal” sexuality will be classified as mentally impaired and curable through drugs and reparative therapy , and for those who've obtained corrective surgery will be classified as permanently disabled. if you wish to actually learn I suggest you visit your library, and read about sociology, women's studies along with works from various sexologist. otherwise asking questions such here on Y/A is equivalent to creating theories of creationism based upon a rock.", 11497, "4TYev4kDaa", 0],
