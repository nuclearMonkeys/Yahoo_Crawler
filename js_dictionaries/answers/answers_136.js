As far as being more that slightly, it all depends on he individual, genetics, and if they have any health issues. The thing about being underweight is that the individual is usually weak, frail, and often lacks daily nutrients. So I'd say being underweight is more scary than being overweight, unless the individual is like 300lbs over weight, then it may be about the same. ", 1079, "None", 1],

	6819 : ["Because we only have agriculture for 10,000 years, when it was invented at the end of the last ice age. Agriculture is what enabled humans to spend their time inventing new things and learning about nature, because it frees many people from having to look for food daily. Also, some disasters in the past, such as the explosion of a big volcano, can darken the skies for many years, and it causes crop failure. Many empires have fallen as a result. When there is lack of food and lack of order, then technological advances grind to a halt. Who has time to look at the stars at night for example, when the belly is empty and a person has to rest up for a hunt the following day. Scientists now can make a connection between the explosion of a giant volcano in Indonesia and crop failures in many areas around the world, and the crop failures ended some civilizations and sent Europe into the Dark Ages. Because we have not had consistently good weather for the past 10,000 years, technological progress starts and it sometimes stops. Also, religion often play a role in halting progress.
