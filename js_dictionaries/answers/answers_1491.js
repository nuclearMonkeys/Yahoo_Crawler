	80216 : ["A few things that turn men off: 1. Harping about politics. (If I hear another woman talk about women's rights, or animal rights I am going to vomit. And if I hear that classic tangent about how women have periods and babies, I will order a very expensive dinner, eat, and leave her there to pick up the check.) 2. expecting us to meet your parents. (Every woman has at least one psychotic parent.) 3. Talking about your sexual history, especially on the first date (or worse yet, comparing your date to past lovers.) 4. Expecting me to pay for EVERYTHING. (I'm broke, the economy is a terrible state, and somehow I'm expected to buy her things.) 5. Bad hygiene. If the floor of your car or house is covered in garbage, or has animal excrement, I will leave immediately. (Yes. some women really are that sloppy.) 6. Gossip is a very big red flag. Things I would like to see more of on a date: 1. manners: remembering to say \"thanks for dinner\" will earn you a lot of points. (Please don't get into a phone conversation with one of your friends while we're at the table of a restaurant [unless it's important], it's incredibly rude.) 2. Give feedback: Are you interested or not? Do you want to see me again, or not? (Are you interested in a relationship, or are you just using me for a free dinner? That's what men are wondering on every date.)", 9013, "None", 0],
	80217 : ["Mine most romantic experience was last fall 07.. I was home alone just doing some laundry and wandering around the house, it was so beautiful day sun was shining and there were fallen leaves in the streets. My Tiger came home, he was just still and stared to my eyes and i stared back and then he just pass me something and i looked down and it was this big yellow/red leave.. It was the moment and how he did it, he just passed that leave to me in silence like it would be the beautifulest rose posy, or most brightest pearl, but it was just a humble dead leave... And i just whispered thank you (\"kiitos\"by my language) and we both stood there still in silence my head in his chest.

	80218 : [". Q1...Be AUTHENTIC, true, connected, valuing and celebrating of her and the love that's shared.  To verbalize his love to her is a precious bonus. Q2...Valentines Day ?  Don't do common cliche \"acts\".  Instead be natural, of ease, share simple favorite foods, share a walk, talk of love, express how you value the love you share . . . Next day or few days later present her with simple flower found in yard or field...look at her and express how she warms your heart.  To \"shower\" her with ONLY on special holidays is shallow and hurtful to the heart. Q3...Same reply for gestures of love towards a man or woman.  In addition to that remember what is special to your dear one and present that to them.  A few savoring chocolates, not an entire box.  Set up couch and favorite beverage and watch their favorite show or movie on t.v..  Snuggle with them and read poetry, funny book, sing softly to them, whatever personally pleases them...that's what you do. Relate to the shared love and the heart . . . NOT the stores and commercialism that's out there.  How was love expressed 2,000 or 500 years ago ?  Express love that way...No matter if holiday or not. With all this, have awareness to hug their soul, not just their body.  Speak to and \"touch\" their soul, not just the person. .", 9013, "None", 3],

	80242 : ["Hawaii is great! If you love the beach, there's famous Waikiki and other beaches. It's on the island of Oahu. I went there (to Honolulu) in 1980, yes, that long ago. So, I do not remember what the name of the hotel was where we stayed. We were on tour so we saw a lot of places that are usually covered in tours like:the blow-hole,the Punchbowl,saw a Polynesian show , to name a few. Another favorite destination of mine for vacation is San Francisco. (I love it so much that I visited it twice!) It is a beautiful city: look for the Golden Gate Bridge, take some pictures; Lombard Street which is the crookedest street in the world, eat some seafood and shop for souvenirs, perhaps a San Francisco T-shirt? at Fisherman's Wharf, visit Chinatown and eat great Chinese food, ride the cable car for the experience. You can also take tours (maybe you can look up a travel agent whilst there or, like me, I found a brochure that had a tour to Yosemite.) That was a good tour. Yosemite is a must-see, if you are in that area. I also took a tour to Monterey and Carmel- by- the- sea: great Pacific Ocean views and the way those Cypress trees grow along that coast, all twisty in the trunks, make good background for your snapshots! Or for an artist's painting. Now, I don't remember where I stayed the first time I was there. I was on a tour package deal. But the second time, I visited the city on my own and I stayed at the YWCA hostel.  If you drive up the Pacific Coast, Northern California, near Crescent City, I was told you could see those majestic Redwood trees. I did not go there but have seen pictures. But Oregon is a lovely state to visit. I went to Portland, OR. I took the scenic trail which takes you to a series of pretty waterfalls. I visited Pittock mansion and the beautiful Washington Park, where they have a rose garden with so many varieties of roses. I enjoyed walking between the rows of roses , sniffing the air because it had the sweet scent of roses! On a clear day, you can see the lovely Mount Hood from the Park. I also took a local tour that took me to Timberline Lodge in Mt Hood. If I remember right, someone told me that the facade of Timberline Lodge on Mt Hood was featured as the outside  front view of the large hotel in the original movie of \"The Shining\" starring Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall. I also visited Bonneville Fish hatchery and Bonneville Dam (all part of the local tour). I travelled alone and that's why I joined local tours. I think it's the Grayline tours. They were good!

	80243 : ["Hawaii! It was so laid back...taking a Hawaiian cruise is going to be the easiest on everyone in the family. There is less pressure on the parents as far as renting a car, using a map, etc. You get to experience multiple islands... it will be both fun and educational! You can do excursions at each port such as: snorkeling with sea turtles, fishing, going to a pineapple or macadamia nut plantation, going up to a volcano, going bike riding on the coast, or you just lay on the beach! The cruise ship will also have stuff to keep everyone fed and entertained. You can do as much or as little as you wish!
