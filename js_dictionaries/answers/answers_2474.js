	129521 : ["I find your question very interesting and thought-provoking. The Bible promises that God will create a new heaven and a new earth in which perfect righteousness will rule. God created man with free will to either obey or disobey Him. As we have seen in the first Eden, man chose to disobey God, and we all reap the consequences now.  However, those who belong to Jesus will inhabit the new heaven and earth, but out of their free choice will obey God, because they have experienced the consequences of sin and will never want to go down that dark road again. Maybe this is why God allowed the first Eden to happen, even to the point of being willing to have Jesus take upon Himself our death penalty, because He values our free will so much that He would not create a \"controlled environment\" in which we ONLY would obey. Would your experiment bring an end to Christianity? I would say yes and no. Yes, because then no Savior was needed. No, because true Christianity is being in a loving RELATIONSHIP with God... and if Adam and Eve had obeyed God the relationship would have never been broken. \"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare.  Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness.\" 2. Peter 3:10-13", 11034, "T0oKiNftaa", 0],
	129522 : ["Too funny...how could a \"totally controlled\" environment possibly replicate the single-rule environment of Eden?  The children would have to be placed in this environment as newborns to control for the influence of all the other rules that are necessarily imposed on \"innocent children\" by their caregivers from the moment of their birth.  I'm convinced that if you could put two children in an environment where they could do anything they want EXCEPT eat a particular kind of food, that one of those \"innocent\" children would kill the other one in a squabble over a toy long before they made it to that tree.  ...and if, by some miracle, they survived long enough to meet that talking animation and he promised them that they would be \"all grown up\" and wouldn't need their God any more if they ate that food, they'd grab it with both hands!!!  I have to wonder how many children you have...mine started rebelling against me when he was about a year old...perhaps even earlier...I've never met a parent who would claim that any child older than two or three had never deliberately disobeyed one of the rules they set for that kid.  The chances of your hypothetical Eve saying  \"No way, I'm obeying God\"  make a snowball's chance in Phoenix in July (or hell if you prefer :) ) seem astronomical by comparison! The amount to \"environmental control\" required to bring my \"innocent\" seven year old to the point where he obeys most of my rules is HUGE...and he still tries to take advantage of opportunities to break a rule when he imagines there is a potential reward for doing so!", 11034, "AA10945101", 0],

In 2003, while the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, Frank opposed a Bush administration proposal for transferring oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from Congress and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to a new agency that would be created within the Treasury Department. The proposal reflected the administration's belief that Congress \"neither has the tools, nor the stature\" for adequate oversight.

	129551 : ["Genesis shows how expansive God's gifts are. Only one thing is prohibited, which does not infringe on humanity's freedom one whit. It is a regulated freedom designed to protect from experiencing evil. When the serpent comes along, he suggests that God is withholding something good. He wanted to undermined God's great bounty by suggesting God was not good, after all. The serpent maximised the prohibition (saying it was more than what God actually said) and minimised the provision (inferring one more thing was needed).That was the same temptation he brought to Jesus in the wilderness. It's the same one offered to us today. There was nothing in this about sex. God had told them to procreate before casting them out of the Garden. The fig-leaf stuff showed how guilt affects us. The provision of animal skins shows how God will still care for us even when we sin; animals had been dying naturally long before Adam and Eve arrived, otherwise they would have had no comprehension of what death meant. God could have used a fresh animal corpse for the new clothes. Knowing they were going out into the cursed land, they would need warm, protective clothes. Fig-leaves would have been hopelessly inadequate. Yahweh did not admit He had lied (in 3:22). He pointed out that by Adam and Eve deciding He was a liar, they had experienced evil, whereas before they had only known good. They were made in God's image, yet discontent with that caused them to aspire to being equal to God - the sin for which Satan was thrown out of heaven.
