Monzon would offset Greb's aggressiveness and dirty tactics by doing some of the same. He would \"hide\" his right cross by throwing his probing left jab to the left eye of Greb and then drop the right cross. Greb would do some effective work to Monzon's body when he was able to get inside.

	73566 : ["Good question. Both were roughly the same size and both were not polished although were very big punchers. Max Baer was tough, athletic and had a great right hand but his problem was that he rarely took anything seriously, he would slack off in his training believing that his right hand was all he would ever need. However when he was serious he was a top level fighter. Jefferies won the world heavyweight title in only his thirteenth fight, he was fighting top opposition almost from the start, he was extremely tough and durable, he was famed for being able to withstand a terrible beating and then come back to win. In one of his two fights with Bob Fitzsimmons he had both cheekbones and his nose broken before KO'ing Fitzsimmons. Against James J. Corbett he was outboxed for 20 rounds before coming back to win.  He was a big heavyweight for his day, very strong and was considered almost impossible to hurt. He only lost one, coming out of a six year retirement to fight Jack Johnson. I think that even a serious Baer would have his hands full with Jefferies, Baer wasn't a boxer so would be toe to toe with Jefferies and very few could out tough Jefferies. Baer fights bravely but gets knocked out in the later rounds. Jefferies KO11.", 8737, "KmeFmRz6aa", 3],

Lee Harvey Oswald was already compromised by them and became a perfect fall guy. They got even, Castro ended the attempts on his life and Oswald got framed.

	73583 : ["JFK took a stand against the military-industrial-banking establishment. I have yet to see this ethics presence in Obama, but I have seen it in Ron Paul. John F. Kennedy vs The Federal Reserve On June 4, 1963, a virtually unknown Presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to basically strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. With the stroke of a pen, President Kennedy declared that the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank would soon be out of business. The Christian Law Fellowship has exhaustively researched this matter through  the Federal Register and Library of Congress. We can now safely conclude that this Executive Order has never been repealed, amended, or superceded by any subsequent Executive Order. In simple terms, it is still valid. When President John Fitzgerald Kennedy - the author of Profiles in Courage -signed this Order, it returned to the federal government, specifically the Treasury Department, the Constitutional power to create and issue currency  -money - without going through the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank.  President Kennedy's Executive Order 11110 [the full text is displayed further below] gave the Treasury Department the explicit authority: \"to  issue silver certificates against any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver dollars in the Treasury.\" This means that for every ounce of silver in the U.S. Treasury's vault, the government could introduce new money into circulation based on the silver bullion physically held there. As a result, more than $4 billion in United States Notes were brought into circulation in $2 and $5 denominations. $10 and $20 United States Notes were never circulated but were being printed by the Treasury Department when Kennedy was assassinated. It appears obvious that President Kennedy knew the Federal Reserve Notes being used as the purported legal currency were contrary to the Constitution of the united States of America. United States Notes\" were issued as an interest-free and debt-free currency backed by silver reserves in the U.S. Treasury. We compared a \"Federal Reserve Note\" issued from the private central bank of the United States (the Federal Reserve Bank a/k/a Federal Reserve System), with a \"United States Note\" from the U.S. Treasury issued by President Kennedy's Executive Order. They almost look alike, except one says \"Federal Reserve Note\" on  the top while the other says \"United States Note\". Also, the Federal Reserve Note has a green seal and serial number while the United States Note has a red seal and serial number. President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 and the United States Notes he had issued were immediately taken out of circulation.  Federal Reserve Notes continued to serve as the legal currency of the nation. According to the United States Secret Service, 99% of all U.S. paper \"currency\" circulating in 1999 are Federal Reserve Notes. Kennedy knew that if the silver-backed United States Notes were widely circulated, they would have eliminated the demand for Federal Reserve Notes. This is a very simple matter of economics. The USN was backed by  silver and the FRN was not backed by anything of intrinsic value. Executive Order 11110 should have prevented the national debt from reaching its current level (virtually all of the nearly $9 trillion in federal debt has been created since 1963) if LBJ or any subsequent President were to enforce it. It would have almost immediately given the U.S. Government the ability to repay its debt without going to the private Federal Reserve Banks and being charged interest to create new \"money\". Executive Order 11110 gave the U.S.A. the ability to, once again, create its own money backed by silver and realm value worth something. Again, according to our own research, just five months after Kennedy was assassinated, no more of the Series 1958 \"Silver Certificates\" were issued either, and they were subsequently removed from circulation. Perhaps the  assassination of JFK was a warning to all future presidents not to interfere with the private Federal Reserve's control over the creation of money. It seems very apparent that President Kennedy challenged the \"powers  that exist behind U.S. and world finance\". With true patriotic courage, JFK boldly faced the two most successful vehicles that have ever been used to drive up debt: 1) war (Viet Nam); and, 2) the creation of money by a privately owned central bank. His efforts to have all U.S. troops out of Vietnam by 1965 combined with Executive Order 11110 would have destroyed the profits and control of the private Federal Reserve Bank.", 8731, "None", 3],

Baer when serious was a deadly man.However, I feel that Jeffries is well rounded in every category and is serious most of the time, Baer on the other hand clowned away his championship.

	73591 : ["I think that Jeffries would be too rugged for Max who was a stantionary slugger of similar size and strength. Jeffries on the other hand was tougher than Max, had better stamina, conditioning and applied more pressure than Baer who would simply hang back throwing his jab to set up his bazooka right hand. I agree that if Baer trained for this fight he would have a great chance at beating Jeffries via decision, his jab and superior boxing ability stealing the fight. But as we saw in many of his fights - including the big ones - he never really took them that seriously. And for that reason I think Jeffries taking a beating at the start from Maxie, who burns himself out, Jeffries moves in and goes to the body wearing Baer down further. Late in the fight a left hook puts Max Baer down for the count. But Jeffries is a bloody mess - what a fight it was. KO15 Jeffries", 8737, "5md2Gq8Haa", 2],
	73592 : ["Guys can we please stop all this speculation about 'who killed JFK'? we know who killed the President; it was Lee Oswald and Lee Oswald alone. The only mystery is 'why' Lee Oswald flipped on that day in Dallas. The best explanation I have heard as to why he killed JFK, was that Oswald was in his own insane way, acting to protect the Cuban Revolution. Cuba had no part in the murder, Lee acted alone. But that was a can of worms Washington never wanted opened because it would have exposed a bunch of Black Ops by the U.S. against Cuba. It also would have made Lee a hero to Marxists the world over. Another thing Washington never wanted.", 8725, "qN8bklFLaa", -2],
	73593 : ["LBJ's military service during WW2 was without a doubt structured for his political life after that war. He was assigned safe duty stateside. He has a short stint in the Pacific as an observer. The plane he was on was shot at by the enemy, and LBJ receive the Silver Star for doing nothing at all. Historians noted that he was the most undeserving recipient of that commendation. The Silver Star is the 2nd highest award for heroism in combat, 2nd only to the Congressional Medal of Honor. It is very clear that LBJ was getting set up by the powers at be for a big political career, An award for bravery goes a long way with voters, though the voters didn't know how undeserving LBJ was of it. A travesty really for all the brave men that did fight and die for our nation. So, the trickery of LBJ was starting early... He could have refused it. LBJ was already in the US House of Reps when the war broke out, he ran on FDR's new deal platform. So, that should be pretty clear as to who the power broker was behind LBJ, that bogus commendation and his off the combat line type of military service. He also served in the Senate before being JFK's running mate. Jumping to when LBJ assumed the presidency, that is the definitive dividing line, the clear breaking point on just when the democratic party swung way off to the left end of the spectrum. Social Security was a legal Trust, that is a legal entity. That Trust was running on separate accounting books all by itself, just like it should be. LBJ did not end the Trust, but what he did was incorporate the Social Security Trust accounting books into the US general budget accounting books. It was there that LBJ had his cronies do sneaky book keeping tricks, and successfully pilfered the money which was bulging into a big bank roll. It was actual embezzlement. Years later, social Security was put back onto it's own accounting journal, separate from the US general budget. Today the people of your age group face working to 75 or even 80 years of age... because everything you make will go to cover the retired before you. What LBJ did with that pilfered money was start his failed war on communism and his failed war on poverty. Jumping to the failed war on poverty, he set things up with special entitlements that still plague our nation today. He gave people a free pass to live on the dole. LBJ's intentions were good, but he failed to see that he set up the poor and particularly the black people into a doomed cycle of poverty. It created the rat hole pit, entitlements. Of having sustenance with out working for it. Human nature is to get as much as you can, and not work for it. the failed war on communism is clear. JFK was getting us out, and LBJ simply opened up the torrent of war. He commanded like an imbecilic loon. John McCain and other flyers were sent out to bomb the exact same rubble pile time and time again. B-52 flight crews were ordered to take the exact same flight path, at the exact same time.... so many of our guys were killed because of LBJ's utter incompetence. Ho Chi Mien, long story short he asked then president Trueman for help to liberate his nation from colonial France, just like we got our freedom 200 years ago. The democrats ignored Ho, so he went to the communists for help instead. JFK found the documents, let LBJ know. So, bottom line is that LBJ was a murderous, lying, incompetent buffoon embezzler that set the course of this nation down the crapper with a bankrupt SS and the entitlement mentality. 50% of the people pay no income tax. The democrats of today vilify the rich for their hard work.", 8725, "yIVwdcwCaa", 1],

Stan would bang the body, as well as the head, and with Jakes willingness to go toe-to toe, I could see Ketchel breaking him down. As great as Jakes chin is, I dont see it lasting against Stanley's non-stop deadly power. If anyone in middle history (along with maybe Mickey Walker) could ko Jake, it would be Ketchel.
