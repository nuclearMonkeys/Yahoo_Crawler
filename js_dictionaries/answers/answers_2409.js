The Bible is the best way to know him because the Bible already defines him.  Jehovah defines himself to Moses:  \"So God said to Moses:  \"I will Become What I Choose to Become.\"  And he added:  \"this is what you are to say to the Israelites, 'I Will Become has sent me to you.'\"\" (Exodus 3:14) That is what the Bible says Jehovah's name means.  He will become anything in order to fulfill his purpose.  That gives us a lot of information about him.  He is trustworthy, he is truthful and he is powerful enough to fulfill anything he needs to accomplish.    We cannot think that we as humans can define him but at the same time we shouldn't think that he is undefinable.  He defines himself to us and that is the way we should understand him.   Here is more Scriptural information on God's name and how he defines himself:   ", 10897, "txNBG27Naa", 0],

It also arises when we partake in an activity in which we have little to no real understanding.  For example, say that someone in your sleepover group suggests a game of Scrabble (I love Scrabble!).  The people who are most likely to find this familiar board game boring are those who don't have a keen grasp of words and their myriad variations, which is a key factor to playing the game well, let alone winning it.  Or, suppose that someone suggests a movie and slips a dvd into the player and it's one of the \"Star Trek\" series of movies (ugh!). Well, if you've seen it a HUNDRED times before wouldn't you get bored?  Politics is another topic that hits the boredom charts, mainly because so few of us have a real grasp of what's involved in making the kind of policies that effect our lives (which is what politics entails).  Instead of focusing on doing something that entertains (which eventually dulls the mind) perhaps you may think about engaging the group into doing something that may be of help to others?  Use your imagination!  Don't just sit around and play with your I-Pods or watch TV!  When you toss curiosity out the window you allow boredom in through the door.", 10889, "Ep5FiJGoaa", 0],

Here are some fun activities: -cherades (in teams or each person on their own team) -murderer (one person is chosen as a murderer (w/o everyone knowing, everyone shakes hands with each other, the murderer \"kills\" people by scratching their hand, then that person shakes one more hand and then \"dies\" everyone tries to guess who the murderer is before they \"die\" -keep the balloon in the air (requires balloons w/o helium) (way 1: everyone works to keep up as many balloons as possible working as a team! way 2: everyone has their own balloon and the try to keep it up while others try to knock others' balloons to the floor!) One theme of games and activities I like in particular is a Do-It-Yourself theme. Her are some things you can do at a party like that: -decorate your own cupcakes -put up party decorations (blow up balloons, put up streamers, throw up confetti, etc) -make your own pizzas (you can buy dough/crust at most pizza places and just buy tomato sauce and grate some mozzarella and any toppings you'll like) By the way, you can make most of these into little competitions: I like to give out goodie bags with a little stuff at the beginning of a party and then let people fill them up throughout the party. You can give candy or chocolates or some small prizes (I do candy because you can buy lots) for winners: cheesiest pizza, most sprinkles on a cupcake, biggest balloon, little things like that. By the end the kids will probably have plenty of candy for themselves. Here's one last activity I really like: Candy trivia (candy can be replaced by any little prizes really) Ask the kids questions about the host (my favorite topic) or about anything you like (celebrities, TV, anything interesting or fun) and then give candy to the first person to answer correctly.

	126312 : ["I think your question is worded badly. Maybe I miss read what you are asking, but here is what it seems like to me. \"Radical\" feminists are 2nd Wave feminists whose were fighting for equality from the 1950's through the early 1980's. Women such as Bella Abzug, Gloria Steinham, Angela Davis, Audre Lordes, & Riane Eisler. Each had their own \"reason\" for fighting for equality and many had \"multiple\" ways they were being suppressed by the systems in place at the time. Some were not of the dominant culture (read as non-White), some were not of the dominant sexual persusaion (read as homo sexual/bisexual/transgender). These women had some serious work to do and barriers to equality to tear down. Do you know that as late as 1974 a woman was not allowed to have a credit card in her name? Or that want ads listed what gender they were looking for so the only jobs available to women were what was called \"pink-collar ghetto\" work like asembly lines in factories or typing pools in offices or domestic work? Or that it was a legal ompossibility for a husband to rape his own wife? Read \"The Femine Mystique\" by Betty Friedan for the context which 2nd Wave Feminists operated in. In breaking down these barriers feminist groups made the mistake of attempting assimilation into the current system as opposed to changing the system altogether. The result was the White Women were able to achieve things that women of color were not, and \"womens issues\" were not defined to include things like poverty or sustainable child care. Women outside of the dominant paradigm, either by ethnicity or social class, felt marginalized by the women who were suceeding. What do you refer to when you claim that \"the RESULTS of the feminist movement are acts of discrimination and the discriminatory laws? Specific would be helpful in answering your question. So todays Third Wave feminists, like Alison Abner, The Gorilla Grrls, Riot Grrls, Peg Yorkin etc. are quick to distance themselves from the Second Wave women and their ideals. I am getting off the soap box now, but do your research before you make claims. Know what you are talking about, use concrete examples. We are not all bitches out for ourselves. If claiming the label of Femi-Nazi actually improved the conditions of women in society I would tattoo it on my forehead.
