She had a very sick mother and grow up being viciously abused by this woman; severe sexual abuse which includes being assaulted with knives and button hooks as well as being given ice cold enemas mixed with disinfectant, being slapped and kicked, marbles stuck up her nose,  broken larynx and so much more. This little girl was so scarred that she developed Dissociative Identity Disorder where she had sixteen separate personalities who'd kind of come out to endure the abuse for Sybil so she could black out and “sleep” through it.  These personalities had the memories of the abuse that were to heavy for Sybil to live through. Each one's taking control was provoked by something triggering these w memories like the colors green and purple (purple was the color of her anger and green was to r color of the room where she was tortured), anything resembling button hooks, the smell of disinfectant, hands reaching out at her and dish towels (also used in the mother's abuse). Sybil eventually found a doctor who helped her slowly work towards what was lying at the heart of the trauma where her personalities emerged until she eventually integrated herself into one person. There's a movie based on it called Sybil and if you're willing to learn more about how childhood abuse can affect the psyche, I'd definitely recommend it/ ", 1040, "Yiz1JmXoaa", 0],

I smoked from age {12-18} and quit smoking when I was around 19.  Smoking weed used to make me laugh so hard at the stupidest things {people legit just look so funny when you smoke} & it also really put me in touch with my intuition. It made me..dreamy. Is the only way I can describe it. Haha. Made everything feel like I was living in a dream, everything was more vibrant visually & sound.. just sounded so much more amplified and amazing. Food tasted... freakin amazing {I remember one time I ate an entire thing of macaroni & cheese without the cheese right out of the pot & it was the best thing I ever tasted} & idk just all your senses are amplified. You get a new appreciation for nature & your surroundings. I always used to call it, Gods little gift to humanity. It just really puts you into a peaceful & loving state. Now I see that it makes sense that I describe it as dreamy state of being bc the same chemical that is released when you sleep/dream is actually also released when you smoke weed. Little fun fact for ya.  I remember the first time I ever smoked weed I was out with a few of my friends & everything was so beautiful to me that I actually remember calling one of my friends & was like “bruh idk what's going on right now but everything is so beautiful & you have to experience this”.. everything just appeared so pretty to me. Like everything I looked at was just laced with love. {I'm also a very dramatic person but hahaha that's besides the point}   I'm a nurse now & can no longer smoke weed for obvious reason but I do miss smoking sometimes & blasting kid cudi back in the day. The good ole days when I didn't have real responsibilities haha   {I remember one time I got so high I legit actually heard audible music in my ears haha no lie & it was the most beautiful music like a sweet symphony}. haha call me crazy I was zooted. ", 1031, "eW4ksnQEaa", 0],

	6276 : ["I HIGHLY suggest you do your OWN thorough research into this before listening to people here on Yahoo answers who tell you to rush your daughter to a shrink who can put her on psych drugs which, as somebody who has taken enough of them can tell you, can PERMANENTLY DAMAGE the human brain and cause damage to the body as well.  And I'm not joking. These drugs did tremendous damage to me and I'll never take them again. Really destroyed the quality of my life. I could write a novel about it. There can be causes for auditory hallucinations which do not indicate schizophrenia and even if it WAS schizophrenia, this is a condition that has been proven to go into remission and often never return UNLESS powerful neurotoxic psych drugs are given which often makes such remission impossible. Go on Dr. Peter Breggin's website, he's an actual psychiatrist who has treated many people for mental health issues, even conditions like schizophrenia, with NO psychiatric drugs because he is an expert on these drugs and considers them EXTREMELY dangerous. You can also check out this website i just came across. I'm sure there are others. Do your due diligence and RESEARCH before you condemn your daughter to a lifetime of neurological damage from Big Pharma psychiatric drugs. She'll thank you some day. Also when you Google, don't go on the mainstream websites always many of which are put up by psychiatric associations and the pharmaceutical companies. Go on websites such as breggin.com, madinamerica.com and others to find out what the REAL story with these psychiatric drugs is and why some psychiatrists (the humane ones) will NOT use them. The way health insurance payments from the insurance companies to these psychiatrists is structured, they MAKE MORE MONEY by prescribing psych drugs during their consultations than just sitting down with your daughter and getting to know her and treating her like a human being.

	6289 : ["Survivors of sexual assault can live happy lives beyond the trauma. They can go on to have successful careers, friendships, get married or have long term relationships and raise families. The key is that they process the trauma in therapy. Invariably they will have PTSD and this needs to be treated in therapy. Sexual assault is incredibly impactful and you will never really understand unless it happens to you. Many people who have experienced it, go through a phase of feeling as though they are 'damaged goods' unworthy of being loved and valued. They may have suicidal ideation at some point - feeling as though they don't want to be alive anymore because they feel 'dirty' or because the trauma keeps replaying in their minds again and again. The best way it has been described to me is this - think of a horrific or scary scene in a movie. Think of the suspense and the build up to the event and how you are on the edge of your seat, the tension. Then the event happens and it may shock you, scare you or make you feel unnerved. After it's finished that's it the scene has moved on and you feel calm again except with a rape survivor with PSTD they relive this feeling - the fear, the build up, the terror - again and again. They could be in the supermarket shopping and be triggered and something will bring them back to the scene of the crime again. They will feel the same as they did in that moment, even if it is a year on or even five years on or even more. It's only when they process it in therapy and talk it through that they can be released from it and the memory can be stored away in the correct part of the brain that stores memory. The trauma doesn't get stored away properly like other memories, it is fragmented and that is why it presents itself as flashbacks again and again until it is stored away properly. The reaction and the way the person behaves is normal. They have had a normal reaction to an abnormal event. If you had been raped, it would affect you similarly. In terms of being hard to live with and behaving in an unpleasant way to other people - this is because they really need support and help but I mean professional help like a therapist. Encourage whoever you are talking about to seek help if they want to help themselves and in turn you will find them so much easier to be around. You just need to be consistent and support them. Trust me the fact that they are still alive is a huge achievement. They need time and support, that is all.", 1023, "vma2SI1Vaa", 0],
