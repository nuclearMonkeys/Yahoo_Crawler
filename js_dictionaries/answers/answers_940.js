If good and clean heart, then we rise higher than this realm. If greedy, lustful, mean, then we fall downward to those dark realms of similar evil spirits.    To see a spirit (ghost) means you would be clairvoyant.  Higher spirits are the angels of Heaven sent to guide mankind.

Politicians often make empty promises to the people, lying to gain votes, while it is the Illuminati who provide the majority of campaign funds. What politician will bite the hand that feeds them? So laws are continuously passed putting restrictions on the common man in favor of big businesses. They control the banking system and value of money. People have little interest and understanding of how the financial system works, so their dominance and criminal activity goes unnoticed. If people DID realize how our current money system works there would be a revolution by tomorrow morning. The power they are allowed is unreasonable. By controlling the economy of a given country, they practically control the country itself. They already rule the world with money so they continuously expand their influence of power. It is best for them that the majority of people remain ignorant of their existence, as they have been controlling global events for years. Pitting countries in war against each other for selfish profit and furthering agendas. Human life and conditions of poverty for other people mean absolutely nothing to them. People blindly follow what the media tells them, not realizing the media is owned by this secret cabal and wouldn't dare publicize their existence. They meet annually in the Bilderberg conference and yet the media completely blacks out, not mentioning one word of it to the public.
