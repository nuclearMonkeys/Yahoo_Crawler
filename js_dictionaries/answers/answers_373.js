	20041 : ["I grew up near a railway line. My Dad commuted by train so it's one reason they bought the house. It was near a station so trains were slowing to stop so we didn't get the noise of high  speed trains. However it was on a long bend and you got that screeching noise as trains rounded the corner. It was enough to wake you up when the first train in the morning ran. It really depends on how busy the line is and the speed of trains passing. At least look up a timetable.", 3287, "HdLKZwkyaa", 0],
	20042 : ["Try asking your potential neighbors what they think of it.  When I was a kid we lived right next to a train line, but it was never a problem as it only ran during the day - if I recall correctly the first train was about 0830 and the last at 1800.  We used to rush up the garden to wave to the driver, quite a few gave us a toot in passing.  We've no idea what happens with the one near your place.", 3287, "91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa", 3],

	20044 : ["The name 'ties' surely suggests that they tie something. They tie the rails down at exactly the correct distance apart. If the rails get too distant then the train  slips off them. It was not the train which was missing the ties, it was the rails. Just go to a railroad near you and look down on the tracks and imagine what would happen if the ties were not connected to the rails properly. The ties are the wooden or concrete or steel things, about 6 feet long, which sit under the rails every few feet. It is unlikely that ties would be missing, but possible, though unlikely, that the connectors which hold the rails to the ties might be missing. Ordinary trains do not carry ties with them. Maintaining and replacing ties is the work of a track maintenance crew.", 3282, "None", 0],

	20078 : ["Cost reduction! It took a long time for railroads to get rid of redundant jobs. Well into the eighties a locomotive still had to have a fireman, head end brakeman, conductor and rear brakeman. But from before the 1930's the brakemen no longer had to walk the moving train to set the brakes on each car when the engineer signaled to set the brakes. Almost every railroad in the US had done away with steam engines before 1955. Automation of hot box detectors made watching for hot boxes from the caboose un-needed. The end of car device did away with the need to have some one watch an air gauge at the rear of the train. Even so laws had to be changed and union contracts had to be changed as technology developed. That said it still seems to me there is a need for the caboose! With mainline trains being 100 or more cars long it gets to be a long distance to walk down a train from the cab and back. With a caboose the engineer could walk to meet the conductor and both check the train line (train line being the brake system).", 3294, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 1],

Reason the passengers have no reason to wander through it getting to the other cars. Some short trains just have passenger cars four to five  of them with just seats. A longer distance train may add a car for food and beverage service near the middle. The Crescent typically uses:   Heritage Fleet Baggage Car    2 Viewliner Sleepers    1 Heritage Fleet Diner    1 Amfleet II Lounge    4 Amfleet II Coaches The Silver Meteor is similar, but typically adds a third Viewliner Sleeping car:    Baggage car   3 Viewliner Sleeping cars    Heritage Diner    Amfleet II Cafe    4-5 Amfleet II Coaches The Silver Star typically uses:   Baggage car   2 Viewliner sleepers   Heritage Fleet diner    Amfleet II lounge    4 Amfleet II coaches The Acela Express trainset consists of two power cars, a café car, a First Class car, and four Business Class cars, semi-permanently coupled together. There is no carved in stone rule of the order the cars must be as in some locations the train does not turn around . The locomotive just moves to the other end for the reverse direction of the route. Many You tube videos explore the longer trains from end to the other. If cars are available they can be added as needed for busy times.", 3285, "6BvkwLljaa", 4],

	20089 : ["as explained in wikipedia \" railway tie (Canadian English) or railway sleeper (British English) is a rectangular support for the rails in railroad tracks. Generally laid perpendicular to the rails, ties transfer loads to the track ballast and subgrade, hold the rails upright and keep them spaced to the correct gauge. \" (1) This suggests that without those ties rails would be able to move apart or closer together due to various outside forces, leading to train riding over them would not engage correctly with the track and could indeed derail.", 3282, "IBoOwFtpaa", 3],

You did not tell us how far it is between your house and rails.  Without that information we have no guess how much noise and vibration there would be. This is a question to ask the realtor.  They should be able to find out how often the track is used.  Whether they come through in the day or at night, etc.  There is a track near where I live now, but it is used once a week on Tuesday morning to do a pickup at a small furniture factory.  So the noise and vibration is not an issue.", 3287, "AA11622701", 2],
