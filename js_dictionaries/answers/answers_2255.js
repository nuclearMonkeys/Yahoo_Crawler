	118554 : ["It would be far easier and less time-consuming to shift the focus of your question to bands that HAVEN'T covered other people's songs at some point or other. I can pretty much guarantee that any famous band you care to name started out as a cover band - regardless of genre, era, etc. It's only natural for young and aspiring musicians to play other people's material when they're starting out, for the simple reason that they haven't had much time to come up with their own yet. Unless of course you meant famous metal bands that have covered other people's songs? But even then, it doesn't really narrow it down much. Anthrax covered songs by Joe Jackson and Trust (French hard rock band for which Maiden's Nicko McBrain was briefly the drummer). Megadeth covered Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made For Walking\" and Willie Dixon's \"I Ain't Superstitious\". Judas Priest covered Joan Baez's \"Diamonds and Rust\".

(I could be funny and say \"1 Really L-O-N-G song\" or 5000 really short clips, so any number can apply) Most manufacturers use 3 minutes per song as their base. Bit-rate vs song quality. Big differences can be gained here. How good are your ears? How good are are your headphones? The bit-rate you choose for your mp3 conversion affects how big the music file will be. For example: a 4 minute song riped at 256k will take about 9MB of space a 4 minute song riped at 112k will take about 4 MB of space That's a pretty big difference in size. How does it sound? This is a test YOU need to make. Try it and see if you can even tell the difference between them. Some people claim that 'Yes, they hear a difference\" that makes the size difference reasonable for them. Others say \"I can't tell the difference\", so then it makes a big difference. Hope this explains it for you. Good luck", 10547, "ABPK7rHeaa", 0],

	118579 : ["The fly is flying in the air in the vehicle, which is moving with the vehicle.  Under constant velocity the air is steady in the vehicle. Here's something rather counter-intuitive: If you place a balloon in a vehicle and let it float, then accelerate the vehicle, the balloon will move toward the front of the vehicle.  The reason is the balloon is floating in the air, which means its mass downward force is being countered by the upward force of its' bouyancy.  When the car accelerates, the back of the car pushes against the air at the back, which increases the pressure at the rear of the vehicle.  The increased air pressure at the rear of the vehicle will push more on the balloon than the lower air pressure at the front of the vehicle, which will cause the balloon to move forward.
