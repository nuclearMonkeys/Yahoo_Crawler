I actually had this pet stick in the 6th grade that I took everywhere with me :|  It may just be a stage that she is going through and eventually she might get over it. Its kind of the same thing I guess when kids used to have pet rocks are something. If shes into stuffed animals you could get her one of those webkinz, which are virtual pets.

	114236 : ["tell her she can have it in the room if it's really important to her (after all, it's not doing any harm if it's just sitting there), but that banging it around and being noisy and destructive with it are not allowed in the house. if she rejects this as unreasonable and insists that she be allowed to use it as she please, you have to step up and punish her because this isn't unreasonable.  she is getting older now, and should be given some leeway as to what she can and can't have in her room, but only on the proviso that she behaves in an appropriate manner in the house. i have seen this kind of behaviour in children who are very insecure - they become attached to inanimate objects for no apparent reason; however, it's more normal in a child of six or seven than of nearly twelve. i don't see why having a baby in the house makes it exclusive of a pet; however, if you don't want the trouble or expense of a pet, then perhaps you could get her a cuddly toy or something to attach herself to?  it sounds like she's having trouble adjusting to the new arrival and the changes in her life. has she been an only child up until now? if so you could maybe give her some alone-time and take her shopping for a gift to remind her of becoming a new big sister - a piece of jewellery or something to cherish, instead of a stick? if she wants a pet, she is probably looking for affection and attention, and if you feel you haven't time to care for a pet, maybe she feels you haven't time to care for her any more.  this seems likely to me given that she's had a stick in her room for half a year and you didn't know! as to her being not old enough to handle it: she does sound a little immature for her age, but a child of ten or eleven is perfectly capable of handling a small pet like a hamster or gerbil as long as you lay down ground rules for where and when she can let it out of the cage, and insist that she cleans it out etc. herself.  My sister and I first got pet rabbits when we were 9 and six.  obviously my little sister needed more help and supervision in dealing with hers, but by the time she was ten, my mother had very little to do with the pets beyond reminding us to clean the cages every so often.  i actually found it a very good way to learn responsibility and because i loved my pet i was motivated to take care of it. at the moment, my older sister's kids have a hamster (property of nicholas, 10) and a rabbit (property of stephanie, nearly 6).  the rabbit is mostly cared for by my sister and her husband, who clean the cage every 2 days, and let the rabbit out into the run every day (really very little work), but the hamster is the sole responsibility of my nephew. helping her to learn responsibility is part of your role as a parent; she is now a big sister, and as there is a large age gap she will probably be responsible for the younger child at some point - better that you involve her now and teach her how best to care for the baby than leave it until later when you perhaps have even newer babies and need the help more.  also this might make her feel more involved in the family, and more grown-up.  point out that a little sibling is better than a pet because they can talk to you and love you when they're older and are much more fun to play with!", 10378, "AA11304037", 0],

	114247 : ["None of the old wives (or mens) tales have really statistically been proven to make a difference. Some common ones, like the sex-near-ovulation-for-a-boy, also have some opposing theories that say just the opposite. But here's a listing anyway. Personally, I like the Shettles timing, and wouldn't bother trying any of the others, but even for that one there have been multiple studies disproving its effectiveness. I did have fun researching it, back when I was pre-TTC! In the end, we just went for a simple Billings method to try and conceive *any* kind of child, leaving it pretty much to chance. My DH wanted a boy, and I wanted a girl, so it wouldn't have seemed fair to try for one gender over the other if any of the methods worked anyway. Do note, BTW, that some of the methods below may decrease your chances of conceiving in general, or cause other problems (e.g. douching, high salt diets, hot baths for the father-to-be). * On random chance alone, you're a tiny bit more likely to have a boy (105 boys born for every 100 girls). * Test tube conception is the only truly reliable way to determine gender. Expensive, artificial, and potentially an ethical issue for some people. But reliable. There are also a number of sperm-sorting methods, of varying effectiveness, again all reliant on laboratory intervention: I won't list them all here. * Timing (Shettles): Conception 2-4 days before ovulation for a girl, and right before or on ovulation for a boy. (Theory: Y bearing sperm are faster but less durable than X bearing sperm). * Timing (Whelan): Conception 4-6 days before ovulation for a boy, and 3-0 days before ovulation for a girl. (Theory: The womb environment in the earlier part of the cycle is more supportive of Y bearing sperm). * Timing: Odd days of the month, at night, or during a quarter moon for a boy, even days of the month, in the afternoon, or during a full moon for a girl. * Diet: Increase calcium and magnesium rich foods for a girl (esp. have plenty of milk, nuts, soya beans, leafy greens), avoid potassium rich foods and salty foods, and caffeine and alcohol. Increase potassium and sodium rich foods for a boy (esp. include salty foods, meat, bananas, apricots, celery), and drink caffeine and alcohol beverages at will, but avoid milk. (Theory: The minerals calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium affect the way an egg is fertilised; the boy diet makes the environment more alkaline, the girl diet makes the environment more acid. Second Theory: This is a “yin” diet for girls, and a “yang” diet for boys). * Sexual positions: Deep penetration positions for a boy (e.g. doggy), shallow positions (e.g. missionary) for a girl. (Theory: faster male sperm get a head start in deep penetration positions, plus further inside the vagina the environment is more alkaline and supportive of Y bearing sperm). * Douching: 15 minutes before baby making, douche with 1-2tsp of lemon juice or vinegar in 1 pint of water for a girl, or with 5mg of bicarb soda in 1 pint of water for a boy. (Theory: Changing the acidity in the vagina to be more supportive of particular sperm; alkaline environment supports Y bearing sperm, and vice versa). * Sperm count: A high sperm count will favour conception of a boy. Loose underwear for a boy, a hot bath just before baby making for a girl. (Theory: Heat will kill off more of the weaker Y bearing sperm than the X bearing sperm). * Sperm count: Frequent intercourse for a girl, less frequent intercourse for a boy. (Theory: The more baby making you do, the lower the sperm count, which will favour a girl.) :)Bronwyn", 10380, "4U0yvTYdaa", 0],
