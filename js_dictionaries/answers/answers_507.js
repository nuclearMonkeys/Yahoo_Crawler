Race horses are not machines they are beautiful domesticated mammals. There are those like me who think horse racing needs these rules and regulations for safety, there's nothing wrong with safety, and then there's others who don't care. And, those who don't realize this billion dollar industry creates and brings us huge economical strength. The jobs created form this sport is from A to Z down to the photographer to the groomer. I realize no matter what sport or otherwise you're going to have those who deny, who refuses, opposes, or is skeptical or cynical about one thing or another. The rules of racing in Kentucky provide for the disqualification of a horse if it shifts its position in a manner that impedes another horse, costing the other horse a better placing in the race. Although Country House was not materially affected by Maximum Security's swerve on the far turn there were at least two other horses that were, War of Will and Long Range Toddy.
