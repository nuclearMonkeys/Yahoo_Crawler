	47779 : ["Fantastic.  At last a young lady who actually WANTS to look and sound more feminine. Young lady, it used to be called 'elegance'. but I'm afraid that it went out of fashion some years ago only to be replaced by whatever passes for femininity these days..  Not saying  that up ton date femininity  has not created  great advantages, but I contend that it wasn't necessary to throw out  the feminine  charm,  just to replace it with a very grubby down to earth modern image.  I think that whilst elegance can be 'learnt', I content that if those that require to actually be 'elegant', if they concentrate on throwing out the rubbish that has overtaken then modern female acceptances of a loud mouth, and racautious  behaviour,  then what is left can only be a degree of elegance, which can be continually perfected. Its up to the individual herself as to whether she thinks that the improvement is worth all the hard work.  I think that if she is discerning enough  to be aware of the resulting image,  she will be delighted. Most of its just common sense. Try to act like a young lady, not a hawker.  Speak softly and quietly, don't screech like a fishwife. realise that to use the vocabulary of a stevedore lowers the tone of a conversation beyond recovery. You can still pack one hell of a punch should your personal situation get out of hand. The opinion of other contributors to your enquiries may indicate just how far any reference to 'elegance' is now beyond their understanding.", 6771, "JW2C4KG1aa", -1],

	47784 : ["Almost anything.  Many activities are just activities, things you do to pass the time. These things don't rise to the definition of a hobby until you dig deeper into it, and that means paying more attention than the average participant does. A few examples: People say watching movies is a hobby. No, it's an activity. It becomes a hobby when the watcher starts collecting the recordings, or starts assembling knowledge, either in their head or in written/recorded form, on specific genres, actors, producers, quotes from films.  This requires attention to detail that average movie-watcher, even if they watch a lot of movies, doesn't do. A person that watches a lot of movies will obviously absorb more detail than someone who doesn't, just by osmosis, but not to the extent of someone that makes it their hobby. The same thing applies to listening to music. Just about any art requires attention to detail - painting, drawing, sculpting, photography. Just about all areas of collecting require attention to detail. Condition is primary; one tiny flaw most would never notice can severely reduce the value of something. Being able to correctly identify what something is, spot the difference between genuine and counterfeit, this requires attention to detail along with the acquiring of specific knowledge, which is what hobbyists do. Birdwatching obviously requires attention to detail.", 6763, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", 0],

	47787 : ["Short question but a very complex problem. If the stencil was a simple pice of plastic hanging from a hook with all the other stencils it's fine. Many of these images come from public domain and copyright free stock image  websites. If it came in a plastic wrapper with a cardboard band stapled to the top with an artist's name on it then it's not so clear cut, Disney has gone after Etsy sellers who stencil any Disney property on things  and other artist and trademark holders are always watching for unlicensed use of their copyright. Some don't care unless your sales are over a certain number. That's why small vendors of posters and artwork of comic and anime characters aren't shut down, their sales are below the threshold. The threshold varies but most don't go after anyone whole sales are lower than 50 to 100 thousand. If the cardboard band is more generic - brands like hobby lobby store brand or stencils for you or similar then again it shouldn't be a problem as many of these are public domain images. If you are still uncertain then buy blank stencil plastic and a stencil cutting tool. Find a find a public domain stock image, trace it and cut your own stencil. You can use that one all you want and you don't need to worry about any copyrights or reselling licences. This  is barely the basics. The rules change according to your country and if you are selling internationally or in your home country onmy. Smple question, very complicated to completely answer within the limited scope of Yahoo answers Edit: it's okay to use licenced fabrics for yourself. Reselling things made with licensed fabrics is a whole 'nother hornet's nest that I'm not getting intro.  I would not recommend reselling anything made with Disney properties. Again, I'm not delving into this hornet's nest.", 6766, "qQqC2cHIaa", 0],

This situation sometimes arises when one spouse develops an all consuming passion for art or tiny house living or chucking it all and starting a career that requires 8 years of expensive schooling or opening an all yak meat bistro or whatever.  When one partner puts their wants and pie in the sky dreams  above and beyond everyone else's expecting everyone to sacrifice everything for that dream then the dreamer is selfish and onconaidwrate. It might be worth it for the dreamer but it's seldom worth the stress for everyone around the dreamer. You have your passions and ambitions too. Why should you sacrifice yours? So come right out and ask the person if they are willing to sacrifice their passion for your passion project. If the person's answer is no then that should be your answer, too Edit: it doesn't matter how important or earth changing the  passion project is. If you don't share the passion you are not obligated or required to sacrifice anything. The passionate one is responsible for their own dreams, not anyone else. I've seen friendships and marriages ripped apart by a selfish dreamers expecting everyone around them to change everything about their lives for a passion project.

The guy had his business, but his wife took the kids and left and his friends got fed up with his demands for sacrificing their lives and pursues their own dreams.", 6767, "None", 0],
