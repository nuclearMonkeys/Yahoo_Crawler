Well, the drug companies and universities (that all get tons of money from the drug companies) will not do clinical trials on the easiest likely therapy:  combinations of histamine H1 and H2 receptor blockers (pepcid and claritin). Histamine is known to promote the formation of inflammatory cytokines and it is also known that the edema from histamine cannot be blocked by just H1 or H2 receptor blockers but by a mix of both together. We likely could cut down on hospitalizations of Covid if this was first line therapy.  The use of Pepcid came about from observations in a hospital that people on Pepcid did had better outcomes, it was not a clinical trial.  As night follows day clinical trials on the combination should have been done, but that might hurt profits from the dangerous and expensive immune suppressants they want to push on the market.", 738, "52Ir0z50aa", 0],

	4380 : ["Yes. In fact: you've hit upon a great method for dealing with such problems. It's common for homework and test problems to have circuits drawn in a non-standard format in an attempt to confuse the student and so redrawing circuits in a format that is familiar to you is a great method for dealing with those particular problems. Note, though, that sometimes the redrawing method doesn't work. Sometimes a circuit just has a strange format that literally cannot be redrawn into a standard format. In such cases you have to use different (more complicated) tricks to figure out the properties of the circuit.", 731, "g9g3fOYyaa", 2],
	4381 : ["Yes, that is correct. For a mental shortcut to work out parallel resistances like that, imagine each is in turn made up of a value that is a common multiple of both; eg. six ohms for that example, as a multiple of both 2 and 3. The upper leg (3R) is like two 6R in parallel, the lower leg is like three 6R in parallel. The overall network is equivalent to five, 6R resistors in parallel. Another mental shortcut to divide by five; double it and move the decimal point. 12, 1.2 1.2 Ohms. It works for any number of resistors in parallel & avoids the reciprocal calcs; as an electronics designer it means much less hassle & less calculator use.", 731, "T5MR7fNHaa", 1],

Do you want it to stay on for a set time then turn off? If it is to stay on until you do something - then use a latch. Either transistor or logic based or just use a latching relay. If it is a time delay you want then look at circuits like the car interior light time delay circuit or use a light -off delay timer or relay. It's basically a capacitor that holds a charge and will slowly discharge until it can no longer keep a transistor turned on.

	4392 : ["The change in resistance is trivial so there is no change in flow.  The wire was not maxed-out before.  If it had been (if the current was limited because of wire resistance), then increasing the cross-sectional area (larger gauge) would allow more flow. If you have a resistance-governed current limitation, there is almost always lots of heat.  The wire tends to burn out fast when that is the case.  It acts as a fuse. Starts fires maybe. Usually, the current is limited by whatever the wire is feeding.  Your wire simply has to be large enough to easily supply that amount of current without frictional heating.  Making it larger won't increase the demand at the far end.  You can, however, exceed the safe capacity of a wire by adding more energy-users at the end.  Then you would be well-advised to increase the wire gauge.", 715, "WbVE1cXKaa", 1],
