Some people had a slightly sore arm for a few days- like a sore muscle after a workout. After the second shot, some of us had 24 hours of muscle aches and feverish feelings. I found warm baths and aspirin helped. If you have young children, it would be a good idea to have someone help after the second shot, since you might want to just stay in bed.

	1859 : [" I'm just getting over it myself. I didn't even bother getting tested because at first I thought it was the flu, but then my son who was sick before me got tested positive so apparently I got it from him. He's kind of young and he was just hanging out with his friends and none of them were wearing masks etc. So he got it from one of them. Like somebody else said try to drink a lot of water, etc.  I had absolutely no appetite for a number of days. And then gradually I started getting hungrier towards the end of the day and in the evenings I would generally start to feel a little bit better. It's a very weird virus the way it affects you.What I've been doing is taking quite a bit of vitamin D, (You can take too much vitamin D but I've been taking 10,000 units a couple of times a week with K2) because from what I understand it's very good for your immune system. I've been trying to take whatever vitamin C I have around also because it supposed to be good for it also. Any other supplements I have around. Trying to drink herbal teas with lemon and honey to soothe my throat and to help with the coughing etc. It's been about seven days and I'm starting to feel quite a bit better. They say it generally takes about 10 days. Of course I was worried that I might have a lingering effects from it because some people do. It's a bit too early to tell. Not much I can do about it if that happens I guess.I really thought I was going to almost die for a while though. I'm 65 and I started wondering if I was going to make it. People don't really know How bad it can be.  I was coughing but not really to the point where I was worried I might have to go on a ventilator or something like that. But I was having all these other really weird symptoms like lying in bed feeling like somebody was stabbing me in my scalp with a knife moderately over and over again. Or I would just touch my hair and literally my hair follicles would just be really painful for example. I think it's just because the virus causes this systemic inflammation in your body and all your joints and all your nerve endings and just about everything in your body just starts to get inflamed and hurts.Just really weird stuff. Even some delirium kind of symptoms like I would lie in bed Not knowing if I was asleep or not and started to hear weird conversations in my head. Really bizarre stuff. And then the incredible fatigue,  like if I just tried to lift a couple of bags of groceries I would feel like I was literally going to have a heart attack.  And was having all these heart palpitations and so forth. Just a whole array of really weird and unpleasant and painful symptoms. Like you're dying.I did not see any point in going to the doctor because first of all I've learned to hate doctors,  And the HORRIBLE doctors here have only ever made me sicker in my life than helped me....and I was too wiped out to even get off the bed or the couch anyway for a while. And I didn't think there was much a doctor could do for me anyway. I'm sure they would've probably just told me to take ibuprofen or something which I don't take anyway.I also don't have a car right now. So I figured I wouldn't resort to calling an ambulance and going to the hospital or whatever unless I really felt like I was going to have some serious serious serious consequence like being about to die. I just kind of stuck it out and I think I'm over the worst part of it now. Feeling MUCH Better than I was for a while there. I literally didn't know if I was going to make it for a while.", 298, "None", -1],

	1870 : ["There was a population of animals that were sort of like a human and sort of like a chimp.  Gradually, some of the animals tended to have distinct traits. Think of cousins with all the same color hair. They're still the same species, but have differences.Say one set of the animals tended to have more chimp-like traits--say longer arms and smaller brains. Now, if the long-armed animals live in an environment that is conducive to long arms, the population will select among themselves breeding partners with long arms. Maybe they are able to reach more fruit than their short-armed counterparts, so they wind up with lots of kids. Eventually, if the two populations aren't able to interbreed, the more chimp-like and more human-like animals have enough genetic differences that they can no longer breed together. This is called speciation. The occurrence is observed in nature all the time, not just in the fossil record.The original population may have died off by this point, or continued on for a while until supplanted by one of the more successful types, but today we have two species, chimpanzee and human, who have a common ancestor that was neither chimp nor human.

	1871 : ["I'm not sure this is a general thing, but I do know that when I, back in the day, asked why my university science books costs a small fortune, I was told it had to do with smaller, more expensive print runs (in part due to the narrow market, in part due to updates) and that the profit margin was set higher due to the fewer sales.", 302, "5c7569b25d7c5784cb92c0ca179f21bcaa", 0],

That is simply not how evolution works. The evidence shows (and DNA is more than enough to provide evidence) that we evolved from a now extinct ape and that the Bonobo and Chimpanzee also evolved from this ancestor.
