	16156 : ["Luck=Moloch=demon.Gov't is killing you with highfrequencyelectricity. Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to \"Schema-nun Antonia\" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (The Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbrings them up alevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put these wreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofTheotokosVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints. Crosses on solesofshoesandbackofpants are blasphemy. Demons makecarpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walkoncrosses. Playingcards mockhow Jesus sufferedonthecross: clubs(cross on which Jesus wascrucified), diamonds (fournails Jesus was crucifiedwith), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesuswas given to drink),spades (spear with whichJesus waspierced).Cremationisdevilworship; onlyblasphemers suchasLenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this. AfterChinaattacksRussia, RuskiOrthodoxTsar (shown by resurrected SeraphimofSarov) willcome topowerinRussia;this Tsar will slay traitors insideChurch andgov't; asaresult, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism=263heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same SupremeBeing [aka thedevil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism will have Pagans walking on theirheads in hell. ArkhimandriteAntoninKapustin left a prophecy that Church of All Russian Saints in Gorny Monastery, EinKarem, Israel will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist; pseudoPatriarchKirillofRussia and MarkofBerlin blessed thischurchin2007.

	16162 : ["The only way to find out is to buy one and listen to it, and make sure you buy it from a place that you can return it. In terms of music reproduction, there is very little difference between electronic components. They use electronic circuit boards or silicon chips, which are not expensive.  They all do a reasonably good job processing the sound electronically. The main differences between players is whether they support uncompressed musical files because files that are compressed will not sound as good.  Another difference is the earphones, which are usually the weakest link in the chain of music reproduction.  Good earphones will sound much better than bad ones. Most MP3 players come with lousy earphones because a real good pair of earphones can cost more than the MP3 player itself. The iPod, being a high end product that sells for a lot more money, comes with better earphones than the under $50 MP3 players made in China. You should get either an AKG or Sennheiser earphones if you want good sound, because these 2 companies make very good ones and make sure your MP3 player supports uncompressed wav files or lossless file compression formats. ", 2772, "None", 1],
	16163 : ["Your problem may be in which mp3 standard you're using.  Any decent software for uploading music onto an mp3 player will give you a choice of which bitrate to use: in general, the highest bitrates give the best sound quality and the lowest ones are always very poor. There is also often a choice called VBR: Variable Bit Rate. That allows the software to choose which sections of music are complex and would benefit from a high bitrate to preserve quality, and which bits can safely be at the very lowest bitrates (such as silent sections). The only reason not to use the highest bitrates all the time is because they produce larger file sizes, so players carry less music. Note that if you're ripping music from audio files which were created from an mp3 or any other compressed format, the sound quality when you rip back to mp3 will always be inferior to the original source. It will be LOT worse if converting from a totally different format such as ATRAC to mp3. The sole exception is if the audio file has been reconstructed from a “lossless” compressed format. So the fix might very well be to improve your music sources and not your player. That may even require that if you have an mp3 library ripped from CDs, you may need to re-rip them at the highest bitrates you can afford in terms of storage space. iPhones and iPods can sound good but they're really not that much different to an mp3 recorded at  around 128kbps. The actual compression methods Apple use are superior to mp3 though simply because mp3 is a very much older technical standard. If you want a tiny iPod which only allows shuffle playback then look for an iPod Shuffle. Apple stopped making them in 2017 (4th Generation) so the internal batteries can all be expected to have severely degraded performance by now unless the last owner has had a new one fitted. But you can buy used Shuffles for peanuts, and there are online guides showing how to replace the battery. Always try to fit a genuine Apple part though: the off-brand examples are often crap; especially so if they claim to have more charge capacity than the originals. The Shuffle also lacks Bluetooth, so if you want to use wireless ‘buds/‘phones with them you cannot do so.", 2772, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],

A true 20 amp plug will have a vertical, a horizontal, and a ground pin and will not plug into a 15 amp outlet, but it OK for a device with a 15 amp plug to use a 20 amp outlet. If you house/apartment is wired correctly, a 15 amp protected circuit has an outlet with only 2 vertical slots.  While this is technically usable with a load that would draw 1800 watts, unless it is a solely protected circuit, that same outlet will be shared with several others, including perhaps the overhead light in the room.  So, a TV in the den plugged in, chances are that outlet you want to plug that heater into, is also connected to the TV, the lamp, the phone walwart.  A trick for a heavy load, is to get a larger appliance extension cord to reach another rooms outlet, which, hopefully is a different circuit.  Older homes with fuse boxes can still be found with all overhead lights in the house on one fuse, and all outlets on another, and it was standard practice that if rooms were individually fused, the main circuit went to the overhead box for the light, and the leads to the outlets, usually one on each wall, came from that box too, so the whole room would go dark if the fuse blew.  While millennials and snowflakes rant over environmental concerns, actually the older generations did not use and discard the amount of stuff that is wasted today.  A 1200 sq. ft home would have a 60 amp electric service, not 200 or 400 like is common today.  An attic fan, and room fans did the cooling, a couple incandescent lamps lit the room, Coke bottles went back to be cleaned and refilled, radios, TV's, toasters, and vacuums you had fixed, not thrown away.", 2792, "JgiGEEhCaa", 1],
