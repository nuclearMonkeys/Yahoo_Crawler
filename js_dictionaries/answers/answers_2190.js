There's only two girls that I personally know that have told me they hate Disneyland and my brother is also one of them. My brother is the laidback stoner type. Let me tell you why I like Disneyland. As a proud Southern California,  Disneyland is part of our culture. Now I can disagree with many of Disneyland and California leftist views but the state as-well as the company did not started this way. I'm hoping that in the future we can have a balance view.  I love social studies and I enjoy going to Disneyland seeing demographics of different age of people enjoying themselves. Whether they're single or couples, young or old, and people of different races. Disneyland always has a variety of things to offer. Also walking through Fantasy castle, it brings nostalgic memories when I was a kid watching Disney movies. There's also the nostalgia feeling of walking through the American frontier theme in the park. I love history, world traveling and Disney offers that.  As a cinema fan I admire Star Wars. I don't consider myself part of the Star Wars fan cult lol but I'm intrigued of the Jedi vs Sith struggle as-well as their music soundtrack. I'm also a huge fan of Pixar. I have a collection of all Pixar movies long before I even like Disneyland. There was a time when I wasn't  into Disneyland. I was more into Six Flags because I like the rides but when I went to Disneyland back in 2008 I found out that Disneyland was more than just Disney princesses and Mickey toon town.  Disneyland also has Marvel studios. I grew up preferring Dc Comics over Marvel but the Marvel universe did an excellent job in creating the Avengers films, Disneyland has that.  Last and not least I also admire a strong company. I find it interesting how a child theme company with a Mickey Mouse icon can be as powerful as owning theme parks, ESPN and other sports networks, different movie studios, news channels, National Geographic and other come up artists. Too bad many in the Disney board are part of the “Woke cult”. I don't think Disney executives are some satanic people but I'm sure some are.  Disneyland may not have the thrilling rollercoasters of Six flags but their rides are unique in their own way that makes them stand out. They also have some good snacks.  That's why I like Disneyland. ", 10424, "TIErCsIzaa", 0],

What he did is take over the student loan program and make more low income grants available. Now that the schools know the government is going to back tuition costs, they are raising tuition. They know they can get the money. The big problem here is student loans. They will go up because tuition is going up. That means students will be beholding to the government and there is no way of knowing what kind of strings will be attached to those loans.

	115300 : ["A woman's testosterone levels are highest in the early twenties. The decrease in sex drive we see thereafter is often due to oral contraceptives which suppress all sex hormone production (testosterone, estrogens and progesterone). The treatment is relatively simple: add back some testosterone. It turns out men and women produce exactly the same hormones, only in different amounts. Men's bodies generate more than twenty times more testosterone than women, an average of seven milligrams per day. Women, via mainly their ovaries and adrenal glands, make a tiny three tenths of one milligram of testosterone per day (1). But it may come as a surprise to know that women's ovaries primarily produce testosterone, from which estrogen is then made. This ovarian production accounts for one-quarter of the total circulating testosterone in a woman's body. Conversely, men's bodies produce their own all-womanly estrogen, converted by their tissues from their all-manly testosterone.  If you can understand this scietific research maybe you will have your answer The authors report an assay sensitivity of 0.07 nmol/L for testosterone, however, standard RIAs for testosterone are notoriously inaccurate at the lower end of the female range. We are surprised that such distinct differences were observable in values below 0.5 nmol/L. Furthermore, the actual RIA used for measuring total testosterone is not stated. The most pronounced difference in total testosterone increase was reported to occur between the 6th and 7th decades, yet for the 6th decade there were only 29 women with intact ovaries and seven after oophorectomy. Hence, we caution a 35% increase on a mean value of less than 0.5 nmol/L in so few women becoming a generalizable fact. Furthermore, reporting of values adjusted for BMI gives us little feel for what the actual normal values were, and this is exacerbated in Table 2 in which values were adjusted for both age and BMI.  Although ovarian stromal hypertrophy and hyperplasia may sometimes persist or develop after menopause, probably secondary to elevated LH levels and individual sensitivity, resulting in increased testosterone production (6), other researchers have not found this to be the general rule (7). That \"... levels in women more than 70 yr of age or 20 yr post menopause were comparable to premenopausal levels\" is also questionable. In Fig. 3 in the article, the dotted lines indicate the mean testosterone level for premenopausal women as being between 0.6–0.7 nmol/L. However, according to Sinha-Hikim et al. (8), who defined the range of total and free testosterone levels during the normal menstrual cycle in healthy women, the mean testosterone level across the cycle was 1.20 ± 0.69 nmol/L and the mean free testosterone was 12.8 ± 5.59 pmol/L. These levels were measured using an equilibrium dialysis method, and the sensitivity of the total testosterone assay was increased to 0.008 nmol/L. The results from that study are sound and have been used as references in many other studies. Furthermore, these testosterone levels are in agreement with those reported in other literature (9, 10).

	115310 : ["Wait at least 2.5 hours after eating before training or racing, this will prevent the felling of nausea during and after practices and when performing in competitions. Two days before a meet, do very light practices and increase the fluids and salt in your diet. The fluids and salt helps you stay hydrated and is an important element in conducting electrical impulses to your muscles for proficient performances. A better 100m run – form and technique will get you there. I think the key to running in any race well is to stretch your leg muscles first, especially the front and back part of the thigh for sprinters. Then take a warm up jog around the track, focus on getting your legs to feel loose. On the back stretch of the track focus on lifting your knees in a comfortable jog and as you come around the second curve, focus on pumping your arms around it. If you want to be better than most sprinters then you must understand this concept, perfecting your technique in sprinting will improve your speed. To measure your progress, set your objective on bettering your best, not on beating someone in particular. There are three phases to sprinting the 100, they are; the start, the first 60 and, the last 40. The Start: Standing Starts: If you are taking a standing start do this. 1.) Place one leg out in front of the other. 2.) If your right foot is out front, hold your right hand and arm behind you and set your left arm and hand in front of you. Throw your right arm forward and left arm back to start. 3.) Do the reverse of 2, if your left foot is forward. 4.) Take a deep breath and hold it until the gun goes off. Make no wasted motions moving forward. Starting Block Position: If you are down on one knee at the start, with or without starting blocks, do this. 1.) Get into the set position by placing both hands just behind the starting line. Have your hands open and have your thumbs facing each other. 2.) When the starter says set, raise your hips to where it feels like it is shooting a straight line to the finish line. This is very important; never raise your hips all the way up. 3.) When you feel comfortable in this position, take a deep breath and hold it until the gun goes off. If you are in blocks, push out with both feet, not just one. 4.) Important! When the gun goes off which hand should come up first? If your right knee is up when you get into the starting block position, then your right hand comes up first and your left hand moves backwards. 5.) The reverse is true for number 4, if your left knee is up, then left hand is up first. The First 60: Think of yourself as coming out of the start like a rocket being fired at a 45 degree angle. You want to hold that angle for about 10m out with your head still looking down. There is not much thinking going on at this point. Once you become erect in running posture, focus on being relaxed while running. You do this by relaxing your shoulders, swinging your arms in a straight line, having your hands come up towards the side of your face, keeping your shoulders from moving back and forth and, lifting your knees as high as possible. Your mind is clear at this time, so you can think about this as you run for the next 50m. The Last 40: This is where the good separate from the not as good. Holding top speed past this point takes technique. If you are beginning to feel stiff and start to jerk at this point, you have not been relaxed enough in your running. You will go no faster. If you are feeling comfortable at this point and want to shift into a faster speed do this. Open your hands wide open. Hold your elbows at about a stiff 45 degrees and begin pumping your elbows to the back harder and faster while staying relaxed. Your hands should come up to the sides of your head. Do not think about your legs at all, at this point, because the faster you move your arms back, your legs will automatically follow. This does not work the other way around, think of moving your legs faster to run faster – will not work while running at top speed. Slowing down before the finish line will cost you in this race - so don't. To condition yourself for the 100m, try running 150m running at about 85 percent of your top speed. Focus on your form, breath with your mouth and, push the air in and out of your body with your stomach.

	115328 : ["Before I give you a comeback I have to say that you really shouldn't be drinking at that age. This is an article on way you should stop:     Adolescence is a transition time when the body is undergoing many significant changes, such as hormonal alterations and brain development.  It is also a time when young people start to associate more with friends and associates beyond their childhood contacts.  They feel an increased pressure to ‘fit in' or ‘go along with the crowd' in order to be accepted socially. These new circumstances can be confusing and difficult for the youth to understand and deal with.  Often their ability to make correct or safe decisions is also at a stage of immaturity. Exposing the brain to alcohol during this period may interrupt key processes of brain development, possibly leading to mild cognitive impairment as well as to a further escalation of drinking.     Alcohol is absorbed very rapidly into the blood stream from the stomach lining, in as short a time as 5 to 10 minutes and it's effects last for several hours depending on the amount ingested and how quickly it was consumed.  Females absorb alcohol faster than males because their bodies contain less water.  The water dilutes the alcohol and so the same amount of alcohol will produce a higher concentration in the blood.  After consuming only 2 to 3 normal strength beers, or 4 or 5 standard glasses of wine, most people will feel less inhibited and more relaxed.  Anything consumed after this amount most people slur their speech and become less coordinated and clumsy.  Some people have increased emotional reactions.  More alcohol could result in staggering, double vision, and loss of balance, nausea, vomiting and an impression of the room spinning.     Aside from the fact that underage drinking is illegal, it poses a high risk to both the individual and society.  We will discuss some of the consequences of teen alcohol abuse.   Drinking and Driving      Suicide     Alcohol use interacts with conditions such as depression and stress to contribute to suicide, the third leading cause of death among people between the ages of 14 and 25.  In one study, 37 percent of eighth grade females who drank heavily reported attempting suicide, compared with 11 percent who did not drink.   Sexual Assault  Sexual assault, including rape, occurs most commonly among women in late adolescence and early adulthood, usually within the context of a date.  In one survey, approximately 10 percent of female high school students reported having been raped.  Research suggests that alcohol use by the offender, the victim or both, increase the likelihood of sexual assault by a male acquaintance.    High-Risk Sex     Research has associated adolescent alcohol use with high-risk sex, for instance, multiple partners or unprotected sex.  The consequences of high-risk sex also are common in this age group, particularly unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.  According to a recent study, the link between high-risk sex and drinking is affected by the quantity of alcohol consumed.  The probability of sexual intercourse is increased by drinking amounts of alcohol sufficient to impair judgment, but decreased by drinking heavier amounts that result in feelings of nausea, passing out, or mental confusion.     Binge Drinking.  Though most college drinkers would deny it, young people do die solely from drinking.  In 1995, 318 people ages 15 to 24 died from alcohol poisoning alone, man of them after a night binge at college.  At the University of Virginia, a tradition that has seniors drinking a fifth of hard liquor at the final game of the football season (so-called “Fourth-year Fifth”) has killed 18 students since 1990.

You weren't there when these pictures were taken or know if I even drank or not. Why should I even care what your opinion is? My confidence cannot be affected by any hater on the internet so stop wasting my time and go find something more meaningful to spend your time on.", 10421, "Syn2excFaa", 0],
