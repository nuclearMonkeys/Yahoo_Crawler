	55724 : ["Alex Rodriguez? You mean that same guy that's one of the most unconsistent players today, have a huge ego and hardly any leadership, and is an absolute mess with the news, which in turn hurts the organazation? I'd like to say Jim Thome, but $15,000,000 is a little too much for a guy that's hitting near .260 every season. However, he does have a total of 111 home runs over three seasons with the Chi Sox, and is an expirenced team leader. He's one of the nicest guys in baseball, takes part in promotions, and host annual charity events (he actually organizes it).  Grady Sizemore is making less than $5 million (after a recent contract), but would be making over $15 million on any other team. He is a team leader who boosts the chemistry, plays the game the way it's supposed to be played, and takes part in charity events. He's practicaly the face of that franchise. He gets my vote.", 7881, "HP75NEbNaa", 3],

He is very well liked in his community with the Pujols Family Foundation that focuses on faith, family and others. He is the best player on the team and the most important Cardinal in the organization besides the GM, Manager, and coaches.", 7881, "None", 4],
	55726 : ["I honestly think Albert Pujols is worth everything. Every year, he puts up MVP numbers, which in turn, draw paying crowds to watch him play. And then sports channels will cover the Cardinals and businesses will pay to have their ad on the channel. I know that the network gets that money, but who does the network pay? The Cardinals. And just loo at the work he has done around him. He started the Pujols Family fund for children with down syndrome and he always gives back to his native country, the Dominican Republic, by going down there and giving money, clothes, you name it to the people in need. Also, look at who he is married to. He found out that the woman he was dating already had a child who had down syndrome but he married her any way and treated the child like his own. If that isn't worth over 100 million dollars, i don't know what is.", 7881, "xhtXv04Vaa", 5],

	55750 : ["The argument come into two competing factions, Life has meaning and life has no meaning. Looking at the idea that life has meaning it must be understood that when we talk about purpose or the point to life we are by that standard stating that we as humans were created for a purpose by whoever it was that created us be that an alien, god or our parents.  Now throwing aside the parental aspect lets look at the life has meaning camp. If life has meaning and therefore life was created by someone then what would that person want from our creation? Well if you are making a machine you make sure that all of its parts function and fit into place you don't purposely go out and make it damaged or badly designed. Likewise if you have a pet that you want to do something you don't tell him off when he does it you make it a benefit for him to perform the desired action. Likewise this creator we are discussing, would not grant us benefits for performing actions that he doesn't want us to do, therefore in that context our meaning of life (if there is one) is to perform the actions that promote the best pleasure and happiness within ourselves. Now many hedonists would at this point go out and get drunk etc. however this is a misunderstanding because many Moral Philosophers agree that the greatest benefit to ourselves, is to benefit others whilst at the same time benefiting ourselves, by that standard we feel better, we gain better pleasures and when things are needed from others they will be provided, this is enlightened egotism. So if we keep in mind that promoting the greatest happiness for the greatest number (including ourselves) than we are acting in accordance with the purpose of life. However if there is no real meaning in relation to a god as i described above than we might as well just go out and make our lives as long and enjoyable as possible, in this we can then once again bring in enlightened egotism as it benefits us the most, and by that standard we ocne again find the meaning of life to be the same.", 7875, "MsyoH2ycaa", -1],

Experience it, with and without words, create, add to it (don't just criticize it the way little stagnant nihilists on the internet do), go out and make every day count.  And energy is always channeled into something else, our bodies will eventually enrich the soil even if our death-fearing egos never gain immortality. But what you are talking about is abstractions, none of us know death, our fear only imagines eternal darkness or eternal happiness or eternal hell....blah, blah, blah.  Concentrate on the here and now, on this day. If there is an afterlife you'll know sooner or later.

It's just that the technology to find it does not yet exist. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, as they say.
