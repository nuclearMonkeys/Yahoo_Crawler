Others have described khazars as being white with black hair and some as being swarthy in appearance. We know whites occupied central Asia in the past. We also know that mongoloid people migrated westward. The turkic people were likely a multiracial group of people with the Caucasian ones dominating the areas around the middle East like khazaria and the ottoman empire and the mongoloid ones dominating the areas around China.

	7010 : ["Humans started migrating out of Africa about 60,000 years ago. Some of them went to East Asia along the coast. Many of these people, such as Melanesians, Australian aborigines and the negritos still look very much like Africans, with curly hair and dark skin.  Some of these people then migrated to China. Those who lived in northern China during the last ice age evolved some cold adaptations such as light skin, short arms and legs, tall and narrow noses, straight hair, thin lips and a rounded torso. When the ice age ended 13,000 years ago and when agriculture was invented 10,000 years ago, the northern Chinese experienced a population boom and many men migrated south, and they admixed with darker skin women in southern China and the rest of East Asia. That is why we see lots of people with light skin and straight hair in tropical Asia, even though these traits should not evolve in the tropics. East Asians are usually classified as Mongoloid as a result even though they are most closely related to Australian aborigines and Melanesians.  The Mongolians, although they were considered Mongoloid, are actually a different evolutionary branch than the Chinese. Mongolians are actually closely reated to Central Asians. The Central Asians left Africa about the same time as the Chinese, but they took a different route and settled in Central Asia instead of going east to East Asia. The Central Asians evolved straight hair also but their skin is not as light colored as northern Chinese. About 40,000 years ago, some Central Asians migrated again, this time to Europe. Some Central Asians also migrated east to Mongolia and from there many then migrated to North America at the end of the last ice age. Europeans and Mongolians therefore both evolved from Central Asians. Because of that the term Mongoloid is no longer useful, since it lumps people from 2 different evolutionary branches.  Since people migrate, the story gets more complicated because 24,000 years ago, the ice age reached a maximum, and northern Europe was covered by miles thick ice sheets. As a result many Europeans migrated to the Middle East, to Central Asia and in fact all the way to India. That is why these people share traits such as light skin, straight hair and tall and narrow noses, traits that make them Caucasians. Therefore the people of Central Asia are a mix of Europeans and the original Central Asians who had been there since they left Africa. Such admixing means many of them are part Europeans and many are Central Asians or they may have ancestors from both. In fact, everywhere scientists look, they do not find people that have ancestors from a single region, but usually their ancestors were from several different regions. For example, there are people in Ethiopia who have ancestors from southern Africa and also from Europe, even if they look African. ", 1140, "None", 1],

	7020 : ["Humans are not more cruel than other animals. Chimpanzees are our closest living relatives. They are known to kill male chimps from neighboring troops. They are territorial and it is vital that chimps live in troops and they cooperate to defend territories. The survival of the troop depends on their ability to maintain a territory. Similar behavior can be found in other territorial animals, such as lions, tigers, leopards, and wolves. In fact, most wolves are killed by humans, but those that are not killed by humans are more likely to be killed by other wolves than any other species.  Prehistoric humans live as hunter gatherers and there was little need to maintain a territory because humans were nomads and food is not abundant anywhere. No territory is worth occupying and defending. Territorial behavior only began when agriculture was invented 10,000 years ago, after the last ice age ended. Because agriculture produces lots of food, the number of humans increased drastically. And because farming requires land, those who are newly born need to find new land to survive when they become adults. As a result, humans who invented agriculture (such as Middle Eastern farmers and Chinese farmers) started migrating to other nearby areas to find new farm land. The Chinese in fact migrated to much of SE Asia and a lot of them admixed with dark skinned natives. Most living Europeans had ancestors in the Middle East, who migrated to Europe and India after inventing agriculture and experiencing a population boom.  Those farmers who live in a particular region often find it necessary to defend their farm lands against intruders and robbers. In time, villages and even cities started forming, and battles for territories and control of wealth began to happen.It is during these battles that lots of humans were killed. Before that, hunter gatherers often coexisted peacefully because the population was low and land was plentiful and not worth fighting over. If one group makes a kill, particularly of a large animal like a bison or a whale, lthey cannot consume the entire animal before the meat starts rotting, so sharing with other groups make sense since sharing obviates fighting for the carcass. People helped each other out by sharing, since it makes no sense hoarding and fighting over something that can rot and smell in the near future.  Blame the cruelty on agriculture and the accumulation of wealth by agricultural societies and the civilizations that were made possible by agriculture. . ", 1134, "None", 0],

	7046 : ["All species will go extinct because when the sun runs out of fuel eventually, it will become a red giant and it will engulf the earth and wipe out all species. Before then, however, some species will live but some will perish. It seems that large animals are more vulnerable to extinction because museums often exhibit large, extinct animals.  Looking at the fossil record, however, we see that whales have been around for 50 million years and they are still here. Dinosaurs existed for 150 million years before becoming extinct. Sea turtles are larger than most land birds, and yet they outlasted the landbirds. Crocodiles survived the mass extinction 65 million years ago that wiped out 100% of the dominant land birds of the Mesozoic, the so-called opposite birds or enantiornithine birds. All birds alive today are modern birds, and they are a different branch of evolution than enantiornithine birds. Crocodiles are much larger than any known birds that have ever lived. So apparently size is not the determining factor as to which species will survive or which one will become extinct.  The reason the crocs survived but the land birds did not 65 million years ago is because crocs are semi-aquatic but the land birds were not. When the giant meteor struck the earth, it created oven-like temperatures on the ground. Lots of insects also vanished. Dinosaurs and land birds could not survive because it was simply too hot. Crocs survived because they were in the water and the water helped them stay cool enough. The water also saved the shorebirds, which are the ancestors of living birds. Another way to escape the heat was underground, where most mammals lived 65 million years ago. Some mammals were larger and they lived above ground. They were marsupials that lived in North America. They too were wiped out. Therefore size is only an indirect reason why some species survived and some became extinct.  A lot of large mammals became extinct 13,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, and some scientists have presented evidence that a small comet struck the earth at North America and raised global temperatures, ending the last ice age.. Since large mammals generate their own body heat, they can suffer heat strokes more easily since their large size means their surface area to body volume ratio is too small. Indeed, there is evidence that humans existed on North America earlier than 13,000 years ago. The Clovis Point tools bear a remarkable resemblance to the Solutrean tools found in northern France. Humans too were apparently wiped out in North America by the sudden rise in global temperature. Luckily for humans as a whole, the comet was small and temperature did not rise to lethal levels globally.  Therefore the most likely way for the human species to vanish globally would be for a large meteor to strike the earth. A meteor the size of the one that wiped out the dinosaurs can almost certainly do it, although some humans that happen to be underground or in the water at the time of the impact may survive. Therefore even if such a large meteor were to hit the earth, humans may not become extinct. Indeed there was a science program on PBS that explored possible ways for humans to become extinct, and a meteor strike is considered one of the 10 possible ways. We do not have a crystal ball so we do not know how long humans will continue to survive. The reason there is only one living species of humans in existence is probably because of competitive exclusion. We wiped out Neanderthals and H. erectus when humans migrated out of Africa and competed directly with them. Perhaps we wiped them out by warfare. Perhaps a new species of humans superior to us may arise in some remote part of the world and they will wipe us out. Who knows?", 1137, "None", 1],
