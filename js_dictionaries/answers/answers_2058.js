	108664 : ["Those qualities aren't the same thing as being an actor. Actors aren't liars - they are trying to show truth, it just happens not to be their personal truth (or sometimes it does - method acting is about finding some level of truth in a character trait that you can't empathise with. For example, you're not a bank robber just because you can wave a gun and snarl - you can play a believable bank robber by saying \"I understand this guy, he's trying to feed his family, but he has to frighten and bully these people to do it\" - just a random, simplistic example, but you see how it is different from \"lying\").  All professional actors get training at accredited drama schools if they are serious. You need to start convincing your family and friends who don't think you can act that you might have something to offer - get involved in school and local community plays - as many as possible - and take an interest in acting - that doesn't mean watching as much trash TV as you can, but reading about actors, directors, authors, reading plays, going to see live theatre, watching something you wouldn't normally watch to broaden your horizons. Actors have to have a broad understanding of many different disciplines, but if you want people to think you aren't daydreaming about acting, then don't day dream, go and prove you can do what you think you can. All the best.", 10062, "None", 1],
	108665 : ["You can always make your dreams come true, and there are ways around the problem. You dont say how old you are, but that isnt an issue.  Big directors will contact agencies for actors, and to get signed with an acting agency, you need experience.  So, as for getting into acting. You need to get experience. No-one gets perfect the first time, or stars in a huge Hollywood blockbuster, first off, unless incredibly lucky. So, work your way up. Do theatre in school, that is a good start. Then look at some theatre and acting opportunities outside of school, the easiest thing to look into is amateur/ community theatre. You can google for that, or ask via your local library and theatres for the contact details. Then, with a few of those under your belt you can start getting some headshot photos done, and look into approaching agents. Keep on with community theatre and short/ student films while you do it, so you have an increasingly large resume. Not all of that will be paid, but you need the experience and to show that you are active within the acting/ performing world. Be prepared for the massive highs, as well as the massive lows, and the times that agents will turn you away as well as the times they accept you. There are also websites out there that list castings and film/ theatre opportunities. However always remember, that you should not have to pay upfront to audition or join a casting agency. If they ask for upfront fees, they are probably a scam and not genuine. The best of good wishes for your future endeavours. :)", 10062, "bc3a29fe87a18faea81427613782afe8aa", 0],

	108670 : ["They're both interesting ideas, but I personally like the first one better. The second one is too cliche (I haven't read 19 minutes, so I can't compare the two). It's like, every story in the history of high school mentions the cliques, and focusing on the popular kids watching some poor bullied kid shoot someone isn't very original. I understand that sometimes that happens in real life, but it doesn't make for a very interesting fictional piece.  The first idea is amusing, and you could make it really good. A group of friends getting together for a robbery opens a lot of doors, and sets you up for a real plot line.  If I were writing it, I'd make it really funny--total crack. Like, the Justin and his friends break into the bank (or wherever) and are all prepared to steal the cash when they see a professional bank robber already in the vault. The confrontation could be really hilarious, with the bank robber like, \"WTF are you kids doing here?\" and Justin replying, \"We're robbing this bank, and you're in our way.\" :D But if you want to make it dramatic, as you already kind of did, then you could have him killing the guard and wrestling with the guilt later. But meh, that seems sort of boring. All in all, it's your choice. :) Good luck!", 10062, "0XnC2jrfaa", 0],

If you love your Dad and don't want him uncomfortable, well your aunt has a large group allready 2 less is not going to make that much of a difference to her. Your parents will be alone, so unless you don't like them at all and think its okay for them to stay by themselves at home on the holiday, while you are at the aunts' house, who you say you are not close to, I would opt for the parents. You can still have time to tell your aunt you aren't coming. I got a cancellation yesterday and its not going to affect me at all we have 11 instead of 12 and one just said she was coming last night.  As long as its not ON the day it  doesn't matter for those cooking for a lot of people.

The fact that yuo're saying you're having difficulty caring for your other children and feel like you can't function and aren't sleeping or eating well sounds more like depression. If your doctor's office doesn't answer their phone during business hours and doesn't return messages, why do you go there? Switch doctors. Something sounds really fishy. Are you sure you are calling the right number?  Just go to the clinic in person if they won't answer the phone.

I got the damn truck stuck, I dented it, I was by myself and like every grown woman, I started to cry. Lol Out of absolutely no where this old man comes along. I roll down my window, he told me to relax, and guided me out of my stuck spot without causing any further damage. Then it got very movie-ish, he put his hand on my shoulder and he said \"You're welcome. People like you help me keep the   spirit alive. God bless you, your husband won't be too mad.\" And I swear, I turned around and he was gone.

	108699 : ["i agree with much of what's been said already, but a couple other things to consider: * with a summer birthday, your son will likely already be one of the youngest in his class -- even more so because many parents hold their kids *back* a year for kindergarten, which means that even if doesn't skip he will be with kids up to 2 years older than he is.  if he does skip, some may be 3 years older.  that's a big social and developmental difference, and if it doesn't seem that way in first grade, it may well seem it by middle school. * just as some kids sit up and walk early but talk late and vice versa, some kids will read and do simple arithmetic early but won't be early in things like the motor skills necessary to write a long essay, the attention skills necessary to read a long novel, the social skills necessary to forge strong relationships with their classmates, the responsibility and independence skills necessary in middle and high school, or the abstract thinking skills necessary to, say, discuss allegory in Animal Farm or write a geometric proof.  once you skip a grade, it's very hard and potentially pretty devastating to move back, and a kid who would be a top performer in their regular grade in high school can feel like a failure if they're struggling because they were plunged into it too early. * all classrooms have a range of ability.  there will most definitely be other kids in your child's class who are at least a couple years ahead of grade level in any given subject.  a good teacher will group those kids and give them books and assignments and challenges that accommodate that.  it's a little harder to accommodate social/developmental delays.   i would (and did) personally consider a school with a reputation for a challenging curriculum, good teachers, and/or pullouts with a specialist or to another grade for particular subjects, and/or a strong gifted and talented program (or even homeschooling) well before i'd consider having a kid skip a grade.  one of my four kids tested at a fifth grade reading level in kindergarten, with math not far behind.  i don't regret the decision to keep her in kindergarten; to me, the social component was critical, and was enough of a challenge for her even with same-age peers.   while i have to concede that much of elementary school was (academically, though not otherwise) wasted time for her and often pretty frustrating for me as her advocate, it's been far better in middle school, when there are honors courses and more room for kids to work exactly at their own level when writing about literature or devising science experiments or what have you.", 10068, "cAtWxJG1aa", 3],
