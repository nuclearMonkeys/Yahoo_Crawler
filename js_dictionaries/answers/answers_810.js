I understand the second part because I've done it.  In Facebook, I get random friend suggestions.  If the picture is of a stunning young lady, I immediately delete the request because I think it's a scam of some kind. Lots of beautiful women don't believe they're beautiful.  That's because people who are envious of their beauty hurt them and make them think they're unattractive.", 6480, "Je4CIwOwaa", 1],
	45090 : ["No. There's no such thing as being too pretty for a dating site. It's meant as a compliment and, as you've discovered, it's also a pretty commonly used dating site pick-up line. Dating sites are often a numbers game, especially for guys, they'll sweep through, liking the profile of everyone who remotely catches their interest, wait to see who'll bite and then pick from these (and then you might not be making the cut), because let's face it: most of them will get a load of rejections/ignores anyway, so it's a strategy that makes sense. My friend met his girlfriend on a dating site, and she was telling me about the hundreds of likes and messages she was getting while she was on there. And yes, she's pretty, cute, and very, very sweet, but she's not stunningly beautiful.", 6480, "None", 1],

Also be sure not to bring up any of the other feelings towards her that you have on here until after the funeral and around those who loved her don't bring them up at all.

The other thing that you can look for is whether he has to go out shopping without you. For instance, I had a friend whose fiancé  started having to go out to dinners and couch shopping w/ his parents and wouldn't give her much info on his outings and ignored her when she would ask about it...a week later they are  engaged. Ultimately, what you may find is that EVERYONE (i mean everyone in your life) knew that you were about to get engaged and that all of their weird and shady behavior will make sense. Therefore also look for signs outside of your boyfriend. If you pay attention to other people in your boyfriend's life then you will be able to figure it out.", 6482, "None", 0],

	45102 : ["My problem with this story is that you want to have more kids with someone who doesn't pay child support,he is living with you,driving you car and is not financially stable. Do you think it's a good idea to have 5 kids with your babys father?? You wrote on Yahoo answers because this is something that is concerning you. I would say do what your doctor says and not have anymore children.It is not your job to help him become a better man he has to choose to want to do that. If he doesn't become that man, you'll  not only be raising 5 children but additional 1(your baby father). You dont want to go down that road. My advice to you is stop relying on your sister and do you. What if something happens to your sister what are you going to do about getting to work. As a man he needs to be the one that is making plans to ensure you have a ride to get to and from work. And he is working on getting himself a car so he wont have to burden you with running up your gas and mileage.Thats what a man does, he take responsibility and makes things right for his lady. PERIOD! He isn't mature at all. Now you are going to do what you want anyway,but I'm going to say this one last thing.  If you decide to have more children with him, your daughters and sons will choose the t ype of person their father is or become like him. Can you honestly say that he is a role model and really teaches your children how a man should treat a women and how a man should act???? Think about it", 6483, "1XQ25XDjaa", 1],

If you are in a culture that marries for love, I'd say you should marry none of these, and neither should they marry you.  Find one that you find yourself almost compelled to marry, then do a disaster check with family and friends in case they see a fatal flaw that you don't.  For example, you might be blinded by someone's supermodel looks, but friends might point out that she has no discipline in spending, and has maxed out all her credit cards.", 6479, "AA11562326", 3],

	45113 : ["No, you can't be too pretty for a dating site. Surely you know better than to fall for flattery.  Back when I was single I was looking for (and occasionally even finding) gentlemen worth dating via dating sites. I was a very plain looking middle aged woman who was quite straightforward about seeking friendship only, nothing physical, about not having a lot of money or any other outstanding attractions.  And I too was flooded with messages. Many of them full of flattery. I got in touch with other women using the site in my area, even met some of them in real life. And all of them also received tons of messages.  That's just the nature of dating sites. Back in the days of print personal ads in newspapers, there would be hundreds of \"men seeking women\" ads, many of them aimed at long term relationship rather than \"fun times.\" And only a few dozen \"women seeking men ads, many of which were of the \"gorgeous fun loving babe seeking generous gentlemen for discreet afternoon dates\" type. So don't take this too seriously. When I compared notes with other women using the site, I learned that many of these guys would send identical messages to EVERY women who joined the site. Naturally these can't be very personal, can't say things like \"I share your interest in photography\" or \"I like Indian food too!\" So they say things like \"You so very pretty!\" and \"I like your profile.\" Don't fall for it. BTW, there were also ads for \"men seeking men\" and \"women seeking women.\" But not many. ", 6480, "iz1cNz5Laa", 0],

	45120 : ["You know because you ask. All of the restaurants I've managed and worked in, had no issues in putting vegan/vegetarian meals together in clean pans with non animal fats or butter. No two meals were cooked in the same pans unless the meals were going to the same table and not even then if different sauces or seasonings were used. Cross contamination was avoided between, grilled vegetables, meat, fish and chicken, by using grill pans for things that needed to be separate from other foods.  For those stores that had limited equipment, the guest were informed how we could or couldn't prepare things, and let them make up their minds to oven roast, steam or boil vs using the flat top or limited grill space, unless it was slow enough to do a decent cleaning (normally between shifts). Most fryers had vegetable oil/shortening vs beef or pork fat/shortening or lard. ", 6487, "pCTN3G3oaa", 0],

Now, with some soft cheeses, say mozzarella, you have to cut a little deeper to get rid of it all. With harder cheeses like cheddar I cut off all visible mold, including the fuzzy white spots that don't quite look like mold. Then I rinse off the cheese in warm water and let it dry before putting it back in the fridge. What can help cheese to stay mold-free longer is to wrap it in paper towel, put it in a ziploc bag, and dump some vinegar in, enough to soak the paper towel. Yes, you may get a very slight vinegar taste, but I've never found it enough to make any real difference.
