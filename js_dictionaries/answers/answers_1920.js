	101745 : ["Wow, you are in a tough situation. Yes your mother  in  law to be plays favorites. She sounds like a passive aggressive manipulator. Do you think she has an opinion on you marrying her son? Did she welcome you into the family or burst into tears? Is your fiance the father of your children?  But in the final analysis, your in laws to be are A HOLES! That being said how does your fiance feel? If your fiance is on board you should get him to tell his parents to cool out on picking on your children. I'm sure the grandparents won't see it as picking on your children, \"Oh I'm just havin' a little  fun\" or \"Stop bein' so sensitive.\" but these comments will hurt your children when they get older and can truly understand what A HOLES their grandparents really are. If they refuse to change their ways, which it sounds like they won't, then you have no choice but to stop visiting the old coots or at least visit a lot less often. Your duty is to your children, to do the best for them and keep negative people out of their lives as much as possible.   Hope this helps.", 9786, "AA11327241", 0],

	101779 : ["I am in a very similar situation and only found your question because I Googled \"sibling rivalry mother\". I wish I had some real answers for you, but I can only speculate based on my own situation. In my case, my mother says she wants my sibling (younger brother) and I to get along, but in no way does she foster or facilitate a situation to make this a reality. Years ago, she always would prod me to wish my brother a happy birthday and keep up communication (via email), but she never encouraged him to do the same, which really hurt me. It also left me feeling as if the burden of the relationship was all on me and made me resentful, but I did it to keep the peace and to have my brother in my life - mind you, for every 20 times that I tried, he tried once...if that. However, my brother and I have a difficult relationship because as we were growing up, he was constantly reminded he was not as social/clever (in school) as me, and I was constantly reminded that my dad wasn't paying to raise me (my step-father is my brother's biological dad)...so it built resentment on both ends.  As an adult, I have learned to actually see that the fault of this silent animosity between my sibling and I lies with my mother. But trying to speak to her about it ends up going nowhere fast (with her walking away/hanging up the phone). My mother, similar to yours, will keep activities between me and her from my sibling, and this makes me very angry, as if there's something wrong with me. On the other hand, she will tell me ALL about what her and my sibling are up to, because I am supposed to be the \"understanding, mature\" one (I'm in my late 30s, my brother in his early 30s). This is poor behavior on her end and completely inexcusable, but what can I do? She stands between us. In my experience, when someone (like one's mother) does this, it only creates further friction between the children and the only purpose it serves for the parent is to make them feel in control (of the situation and the actions/behaviors of both children), and it feeds their own ego...in some way which I cannot yet comprehend. I just know it's wrong, but also know it to be true. It's taken me YEARS to accept this, though it hasn't made it easier, feelings-wise. I can only suggest that you try to bypass your mother - as I tried - and attempt to speak directly and honestly with your sister and attempt to understand and discuss what the underlying issue really is between you. You may be surprised at what misinformation you have both been presented with which may be dictating your attitudes towards one another. I tried this with my sibling, and it had some positive results (we found out we were both being told twisted versions of the truth about the other by our mother)....BUT sadly, because this has been going on for years, my brother is unable to outgrow certain misguided beliefs about me, and there is nothing I can do about it. I have tried for years with him, but since he won't try back...I have finally given up. Unfortunately, this makes me feel that my mother \"wins\" but while she's alive, this may remain the case. Only time will tell if things will change in her absence (which makes me feel horrid to say, but it's a fact of life). In fact, I tried to ask my mother for help today, asking her to please try to bridge the gap between me and my sibling and her response was, \"It will upset him\" - except, I have never done anything TO him aside from what he erroneously perceives about me based on lies my mother has told him all his life. So when I attempted to confront my mother about this today, she hung up the phone - as per usual. This tells me that her \"gain\" is greater (in her mind) in keeping us at odds than if my sibling and I were to reunite. I know, how can that even make sense...she's our mother and should want the best for us, right? But people are not all black/white and have their own twisted issues for their choices/behaviors. So try to bypass your mum and speak to your sister and find out WHAT the issue is, but don't expect miracles. But at least you'll know you tried. I wish you much luck!", 9784, "jsN7swQQaa", 0],

Then she'd tell me to apologize, even though I hadn't done anything. And if I didn't, she'd usually say something really nasty and call me fat or stupid or something. Ugh.
