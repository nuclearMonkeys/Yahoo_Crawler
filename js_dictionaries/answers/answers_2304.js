When a fire in a retail store damaged the goods, they'd put them on sale -- they weren't necessarily much good anymore, but maybe ok for bargain hunters.  Thus is goes with HD-DVD. Toshiba has stopped making players, and will soon stop making discs. It's unlikely many if any new titles will be released. As a result, they're being liquidated -- sold off basically to get rid of them. That's why they cost less than DVDs.  I guess, if they're about the price of a rental, and you already have an HD-DVD player, that's a good deal. Full priced discs might not sell at all, since, by the time your current HD-DVD player dies (give it at least 3-5 years for the laser to fail), there will be no replacements. Well, maybe on eBay or at yard sales, but that's about it.  HD-DVD was supposed to be more expensive than DVD. In fact, it was likely to be more expensive than Blu-Ray in the long run. BD-ROM discs cost a little more than HD-DVD discs, but not necessarily forever. On the other hand, even before the \"war\" was over, Toshiba was subsudizing the cost of the players.. they were sold at or below cost, much like video game consoles often have been. Toshiba being the only HD-DVD player company and the owner of HD-DVD, they could make this up with royalities on every disc, just like the games consoles do (one reason video games are more expensive than DVDs... the other being \"because we can\"). That's actually a big part of the reason Toshiba lost... they were seen as proprietary, while Blu-Ray was supported by most of the CE companies.", 10639, "AbRfd29Haa", 0],

	121007 : ["From your description is it possible that you have cold sores.  Cold sores generally clear up without treatment within about two weeks.  One of the most important things you can do is to keep your hands away from it.  Don't pick at it.  Picking at it can add a bacterial infection to the viral infection, and it will take longer to heal.  Wash your hands immediately after touching the cold sore and avoid touching your eyes or your genitals after touching the cold sore.  Keep hand sanitizer handy for those times when you can't wash your hands. There are a few things you can do to help the cold sore heal and to also treat the symptoms.  Try covering it with a little vaseline which will help keep it moisturized and so less cracking and less pain.  Don't try to cover it up with make up.  That could aggravate it.  Avoid getting your lips sunburned.  Apply sunscreen to your lips before going outside.   Avoid foods that might irritate it as it is healing - citrus fruit and juices, salty foods such as potato chips.  Try chewing real licorice.  There is evidence that an ingredient in licorice, glycyrrhizic acid, actually stops the cold sore virus.  You do have to make sure it is real licorice, and not an imitation.  The list of ingredients should say \"licorice mass\".   Ice packs will help reduce the swelling and also help reduce the pain.  Use an ice pack for about 15 minutes several times a day.  Generally this treatment works best if you do it as soon as you feel the cold sore coming on. Soak a cotton ball in milk and apply it to the cold sore.  Whole milk is best, not skim.  It will help with both the pain and the inflammation, and if you do it as soon as you feel the cold sore coming on it can help reduce the duration of the attack. To prevent reinfecting yourself, you should get a new toothbrush when the cold sore has healed.  A toothbrush can harbor the virus.  This can prevent a recurrence.     If you get cold sores regularly you probably know about the drug store options for treatment.  Lysine has proven very effective in treating cold sores.  Abreva treats the symptoms well and has been shown to lessen the duration of an attack.  In my opinion the absolute best method to address cold sores is an oral anti-viral medication, Valtrex.  Since I started using it (only when I feel a cold sore coming on) my attacks have lessened greatly, when I do have one it lasts only a day or two, and I have not had a bad cold sore in about 5 years. If you get cold sores you probably also know what your triggers are.  Be aware that there are situations that bring on cold sores that you can avoid: dehydration too much sun, especially sunburn stress letting yourself get over tired fevers, colds and the flu - anything that compromises your immune system dental work Check here for more information about cold sores in case that is what yo.u have.

	121020 : ["umm.. i recommend using Aquafina Chap stick. it's like $2 for a tube and it's liquid and has jojoba oils! it works great, i have the same problem as you. umm.. here are some reasons for dry lips: One of the most common reasons for lips to feel dry is when they're being exposed to extremes of temperature, whether this is hot or cold. The lips may crack and feel very uncomfortable. Using a lipsalve regularly throughout the day will help. Moderate degrees of dehydration will also cause lip dryness. Drinking too much caffeine or alcohol can often be responsible. The solution when this is the case is to remember to drink plenty of non-alcoholic liquid throughout the day. Eight glasses of water each day is the recommended minimum. This needs to be increased during hot weather. One of the things that many people do when their lips feel dry is to keep licking them in an effort to moisturise the lips. In most cases, however, this doesn't solve the problem but makes matters worse. So try not to do this. Sometimes it's irritation from saliva, lipstick or food causing a minor allergic reaction that's responsible for these symptoms. Contact eczema is another cause. Overworking, stress, tiredness and recent infection all lower the immune system, which makes minor infections around the mouth and lips more likely. These can dry the lips out and the corners of mouth are usually affected. Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins C, E and B, and also zinc, iron and beta-carotene, together with plenty of rest and regular exercise will help to keep the immunity fighting fit. There are some medical conditions where dry lips are one of the symptoms. So if the problem persists despite these simple measures, ask your GP for further advice. Most people get chapped lips from time to time. Dry, cracked or sore lips can interfere with many daily activities, such as smiling, kissing, eating and talking. Lips may become chapped for a variety of reasons. These include: Exposure to wind, sun, and cold, dry air  Obstructed breathing, such as in allergic rhinitis, which can force you to breathe through your mouth  Contact dermatitis due to irritants or allergens in cosmetics or skin-care products  Certain medications, such as those used to treat acne  A habit of frequently licking your lips  Dehydration  To treat or prevent chapped lips, consider these tips: Use an oil-based lubricating cream, such as Aquaphor Healing Ointment, or lip balm containing petrolatum or beeswax.  Apply lip cream, balm or lipstick before going out in cold, dry weather. Reapply several times while outside.  Choose a lip cream or balm that contains sunscreen. Sun exposure contributes to chapped lips.  Avoid licking your lips. Saliva evaporates quickly, leaving lips drier than before you licked them.  Avoid using a flavored lip balm, which can tempt you to lick your lips.  Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Dehydration can contribute to chapped lips.  Use a humidifier at home to keep air moist.  If chapping is severe and self-care measures don't seem to help, consult your doctor. Rarely, persistent chapped lips may indicate an underlying problem, such as dermatitis. hope this helps! :) and yes water helps!", 10638, "ydZrs0JRaa", 0],

He really seemed to put down scientific reasoning and simply defined the difference between the perception and understanding of God between the Islamic and Christian world, based on the understanding of the New Testament as a fundamentally Greek-influenced work. The most inflammatory thing I think I found in there was the indictment of scientific reasoning as \"limited\" and inadequate for defining an ethical/theological world view and thus the need for the inclusion of theology as a \"scientific\" discipline with its own \"expanded reason.\" He made good points about the limitations of Man and thus his brainchild Science, and I'd say Benedict is as close to an old time German philosopher as I've seen in awhile.", 10629, "ec40e075ec30f66a9153609ad8b00d39aa", 0],

	121031 : ["Cats make wonderful pets. Because they're less demanding, they can easily adjust to a variety of lifestyles and living spaces. Every cat is a true individual, though, so it's important to take the time to choose a four-footed friend who's right for you. A cat's personality, age, and appearance, as well as the kinds of pets you already have at home, are all things you should keep in mind when making your selection: Choose a Personality. Stroll past a few cat cages at the shelter, and you'll notice that some cats meow for special attention, while others simply lie back and gaze at you with an air of arrogance. There are as many different personalities of cats as there are cats in the shelter. Which disposition is best for you? You have to decide. But regardless of individual personality, look for a cat who's playful, active, alert, and comfortable while being held and stroked. At the shelter, ask an adoption counselor for assistance when you wish to spend some time with individual cats. Kitten or Cat? As a general rule, kittens are curious, playful, and full of energy, while adult cats are more relaxed and less mischievous. Kittens also require more time to train and feed. Cats are only kittens for a few months, though, so the age of the cat you adopt should really depend on the level of maturity you're looking for. Young children usually don't have the maturity to handle kittens responsibly, so a cat who's at least four months old is probably the best choice for homes with kids under six years old. Short-haired or Long? Cats can have long, fluffy coats or short, dense fur, and the choice between the two is chiefly a matter of preference and availability. You'll see more short-haired cats at the shelter since they're the most popular and common cats. One thing to keep in mind is that long-haired cats require frequent grooming to be mat-free. Felines with short coats also require brushing, though less frequently, and they'll leave less hair on your favorite recliner. Most cats enjoy a regular brushing and will look forward to this daily ritual with you. Room For One More Other than those few considerations, selecting the right feline companion for you is really just a matter of meeting the cats at the shelter yourself. If you already own a cat or dog, you're probably wondering how easy it is to add a cat to the family. The good news is that cats can get along with other cats and—despite the common stereotype—most dogs can get along with cats. The bad news is, introducing a new cat to a home with other pets will require some patience on your part. The best way to handle adding a new cat to the home is to provide time for a period of adjustment. You can do this effectively by isolating your new feline in a room of his own for a while—something that's a good idea for a new cat anyway. After several days, supervise meetings between the animals for periods of increasing length. Most cats will soon learn to accept each other, and some may quite possibly become the best of buddies. Some dogs simply won't tolerate the presence of a cat, but by carefully introducing them, most problems can be solved. Be Responsible! Regardless of the cat you choose, you'll want to start being a responsible pet owner right away. The easiest way to do that is to keep your cat indoors with you from the very beginning. If you don't let your new friend outside, he'll never miss it, and will have a much better chance of still being around to sit on your lap a few years from now. The other big staple of responsible cat ownership is having your female cat spayed or your male cat neutered. Spaying or neutering will ensure that your cat never adds to the millions of animals born each year who never find a good home. It'll also help him or her live a longer, healthier life. Adopt a Cat for Life Finally, remember that you're making a commitment to love and care for your new pet for his or her lifetime—which could mean 10, 15, even 20 years. So choose your new pal carefully and be a responsible pet owner. In no time at all, you'll know how wonderful sharing your home with a cat can be.", 10634, "0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa", 2],
