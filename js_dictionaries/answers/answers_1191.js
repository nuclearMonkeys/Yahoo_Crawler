	65047 : ["\"What do you look for when you want to purchase a new computer?\" If i'm buying for me personally the first thing I check is that I can easilly and legitimately get it with XP. If i'm buying for the uni I don't care about this since the uni has a volume license upgrade/downgrade. What I look for next depends on the planned use of the computer. For example I recently built a PC for electromagnetic simulation at uni, in this case I wanted lots of ram (I built it with 48GB but it may get upgraded if larger modules become available at a reasonable price) and I wanted to avoid the expensive and hot running FBDIMMs, CPU power was a secondry objective but I still wanted it decently high so I ended up with a system built arround an intel S5520SC and 2.4 GHz processors (fastest that would fit in the budget I had). Other times performance per core is more important, last time this was the case (a box I was going to use for FPGA work) I went for the fastest core 2 duo dell offered in the range I'd picked (I didn't want to be bothered building a machine at the time), the range was picked for it's support for 8GB of ram (FPGA work is not as memory hungry as electromagnetics simulation but ram is still important). When I bought my \"netbook\" getting a decent resoloution (I do not consider 1024x600 decent) on a 10 inch panel was the overriding factor (and I paid about twice the price of a regular netbook to get it). Recently i've been preffering intel due to thier superior performance per watt and per core but on a budget system i'd probablly go AMD. \"Check out our cheat sheet outlining what you need to look for when purchasing a new laptop.\" Lets see Processor page: what it says is probablly true for laptops but for desktops (and the title of the linked page doesn't mention which it is for though your question says laptops) it's not that hard, just a matter of checking what your motherboard supports and following the instructions. Gigahertz page: mentions correctly that processors from different ranges can have different speeds but fails to mention that two processors marketed as \"celeron\" or \"pentium\" can be based on widely different architectures and have wildly different performance per clock. Also uses the term centrino as if it's a processor when afaict it's a name for a whole platform (processor, chipset, wireless etc). Also the claim that a 2.0 GHz C2D is faster than a 2.6 GHz celeron is almost certainly true for a P4 based celeron but it's almost certainly not true for the core 2 based 2.6 GHz celeron your company just released (I couldn't find any direct comparisons but given how close a 2.2 GHz C2D and a 2.2GHz core 2 based celeron are i'd be very surprised if a 2.6GHz core 2 based celeron beat a 2.0 GHz core 2 duo). On the ram page you claim that ram can be easily upgraded later. It's true that if memory can be upgraded it's an easy upgrade to do BUT it's also true that if you aren't careful it's easy to end up with a machine that is maxed out on ram and still wanting more. There is also no mention of the fact that 32-bit desktop windows caps out at 4GB of address space which in practice means about 3.5GB of ram in most cases. The graphics page is very misleading, yes you may need a high end processor to get the most out of a high end graphics card but for gaming a slower processor with a moderate graphics card will be much better than a faster processor and integrated graphics. Also you claim integrated graphics is integrated in the CPU, this is only the case with the latest dual core i3 and i5, in earlier generations it's built into the chipset meaning you can get much better graphics performance with a nvidia chipset. Also in the case of laptops discrete graphics doesn't nessacerally mean a distinct card. Overall it looks more like a marketing puff piece than real advice and is very misleading in places.", 8291, "3TWjbVq6aa", 38],

The Supreme Court of the U.S. has recently decided that the right to bear arms is an individual right and not a right that is necessarily associated with a state militia. Nothing short of cancelling all gun registration requirements could be more supportive of the 2nd Amendment. As long as Scalia, Alito, Thomas, etc are on the Supreme Court, the Supremes are unlikely to reverse themselves on this point, which they waited about 100 years to resolve, and have now recently resolved. Even if Obama got 3 or 4 appointments, you won't see a reversal of this basic point anytime soon, because that's just not the way the Supreme Court operates. They want it to look like they are just following the plain meaning of the Constitution, and not blowing around in the winds of political change. On the ACLU: They are not a communist organization today. They are lefties, liberals, maybe pinkos, but they are not reds. Most of the work they do is harmful to the country, but that's not their intent. They intend to do good (well -- we all do rignt?). They never seem to take policy or necessity into account. They always argue from an ultra-purist perspective, and they are obtuse, willfull, stubborn, and refractory. On the good side of the ledger -- They are competent. Their lawyers are good. If we didn't have them, we would have to invent them, because the points they make and argue need to be made and argued for the cases to be properly decided. No one else would do that job -- so it's good that the ACLU exists. Also if you ever get accused or convicted of a felony, you will be glad the ACLU is out there. They do protect the rights of some people -- mostly criminals -- but that's what our system requires -- again, were it not for the ACLU no one would do it -- or do it as well. I've been a Federal trial lawyer for 25 years, doing prosecution, and defense, in fairly serious cases. I was never tempted to join the ACLU, but I learned a lot from them, and from their publications. As a supporter of NARAL and NOW and ZPG, I feel that the ACLU has done good work on the First Amendment issues that arise in abortion-related cases. They are very principled. They try to be very ethical. I think a lot of the hatred for them is just partisanship or envy. I say this as a person who mildly dislikes them but who finds things to admire in their conduct and the role they play in our judicial system as well-read but highly predictable advocates for liberal and pinko causes. They would be far more dangerous if they were a secret society. As it is they carry cards, and are proud to be on the list.  I am not a liberal or a conservative. I do not support the NRA, but I tolerate them, like I tolerate the ACLU. I mildly support the labor union movement, but that is a very recent shift in my views brought about by the obscene piggish greed of the corporate executive cadre during the George W. Bush (the worst President ever) Administration. I am a lifestyle liberal and a fiscal conservative. I am a decorated military veteran with service overseas, a former gun toter, an expert marksman. Gays make me quesy, but I have a Goldwater perspective -- liberty is for everybody -- not just for people who are just like me. All told, I find Christians to be at least as harmful and at least as noisome as the ACLU -- but as a latitudinarian I accept both, tolerate both, am convivial with both. Since I'm not partisan, there are far more people who do not tolerate me than the other way around -- I walk down the middle of the street and both sides shoot at me -- but the good thing is that I get to shoot at both sides -- which worked out well for me when I was a columnist for the local newspaper.

This is a general trend in western society of the separation of image and substance. Western society still has a more total concept of sexual relations than Islamic societies. Rather than concentrating on image as the determinant of sexual behavior and rigidly oppressing this it redistributes constraints on sexual harrassment among other factors(as mentioned above). While I do think that it could be more totalised if image was added as a restriction but not in a rigid Islamic way. This is even accounted for through social controls such as calling people sluts etc(though,granted, this is not acceptable in the workplace!). The trend of redistribution of responsibilities is matched by a rationalization of sexual knowledge, a greater freedom in choice of sexual partners, less expectations of marrying off, and alternative methods of sexual release through magazines and alternative sexual lifestyles.

Second - Assault weapons.During the last ban on certain semi-automatic firearms,can any of those in continued favor of such ban list the number of prosecutions concerning these types of firearms?The ban made cosmetic changes illegal without altering the functional systems of the weapons whatsoever.The Second Amendment was not about possessing a \"hunting\" rifle any more than it was about the First Amendment was about nude dancing.  \"Cop-killer bullets\".God,how I love this one.Not one person can identify any specifics on what would be a \"cop-killer\".Nor are there any ammunition makers who make any so-called bullets.There was recently a Chicago police officer who had his handgun taken from him and shot during the ensuing struggle.Was that handgun loaded with \"cop-killer bullets\"?I truly am sympathetic to that officers family as I have an uncle who is retired from the CPD,but I would hope that even the most ardent of this foolish theory sees the irony.  The ACLU apparently believes in the theory that the pen is mightier than the sword.That don't seem to realize that without the sword,the pen is easily silenced.They are and have always been more interested in a liberal and socialist agenda than they have been in defending the U.S.Constitution.They aren't interested in the defending the rights of those whose point of view is different than theirs.It isn't in the interest of the ACLU to defend the things they find abhorrent,whether or not those views are legal and protected by law.I'd also bet that most of the responders here have never even read the Constitution,but feel as though they know enough to comment on what they don't know.", 8292, "293f42f2b7be2f65dd5e6bdaecbded4caa", 2],

Becuase of the nation income identity; savings-investment=net exports. Thus, a reduction in savings would lower net exports, causeing a trade deficit.
