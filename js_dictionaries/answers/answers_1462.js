	78752 : ["No i don't believe it, mainly because i have been a victim of Love at first sight.....id never met him before, hadn't touched nor smelt him and just caught a glimpse of him in the moon light and i knew there and then there was something about him that drew me in and that what i felt wasn't just puppy Love.......i ended up married to him.", 8959, "g2sFRuEUaa", 2],

	78754 : ["Well, I don't know if it was love a first sight, but when I met my husband the first time, I looked into his eyes and the first thought that went through my mind was \"I'm going to marry that guy.\"  At that time he was married so I didn't really think much more about it.  Then a few days later he came over and talked to me ( we worked together) and I found we had some things in common.  Shortly after that we were talking and he said he had to find another place to live, that his wife left him and the landlord wanted the place empty to do some renovating.  So I told him to gather up some ads and I would help him look for another place.  To say the least, he never needed the other place because he moved in with me.  That was back in 1986.  We eventually got married and now have two kids.  But there is definitely some inner connection between us because we very often have the same thought at the same time.  Its weird really.  But I love him and he loves me.  That's all that matters.  He is a great guy and a great father.  Oh yeah, at the time we met, I was of the opinion that I was never going to get married, and I was never having kids.  To say the least, my family was shocked when I told them I was pregnant with my first child. If you have to, introduce yourself and strike up a conversation.  Don't say anything about love yet, after all you don't know for sure.  You might end up thinking to yourself \"God, what was I thinking\".  Good luck though.  I hope it works out for you.", 8959, "0bT3acoJaa", 0],

Wars are now fought over existing land and resources.  \"Holy land\" being a big motivator for war, and with several different versions of \"holy\" it is wholly a mess.

	78759 : ["No, it isn't true.  That's the answer to your last question.   As to your rant, you need to understand the complexities of global politics.  You are looking at this in a very naive and simplistic fashion.  You've got alot of reading to do if your take on this is as it seems. If nothing else, let me just assure you.  We are NOT the terrorists.  If you do all the research and still come back with that opinion, then perhaps you would would appreciate life in another country.", 8958, "3v5ZlP0kaa", -4],

	78766 : ["It seems Americans' sex-lives have become peeking through the blinds and gossiping.  There's no Republican, much less \"Liberal\" political context -- it's just the way people act when they have lost their own self-worth.  And the voyeurs are no better than the actors -- maybe worse. Paris Hilton or John Edwards: whomever the personality, where no crime is committed the public needs to get their minds on the issues and their noses out of public figures' rear ends.  For those that claim responsible high-mindedness, I suggest noting Eliot Spitzer, or, say, J. Edgar Hoover who presented themselves as exemplars and arbitrators of morality -- not to mention the current leaders of our churches.

Sometimes it is a good starting point since you don't want to spend the rest of your life with someone that you don't find attractive.  You can make up any excuse to talk to someone.
