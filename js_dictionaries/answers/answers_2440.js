If he usually plays newer, more detailed games, you're going to want something like a 2.6 - 3.0 GHz dual-core processor, around 2 - 3 GB of RAM (I would say 4 but that brings up some complications), a decent sized hard drive (350 - 500 GB), and a good graphics card (GeForce 8800 GT, GeForce 9600 GT, Radeon HD 3870, Radeon HD 4850). The reason I said not to get 4 GB of RAM is because 32-bit versions of Windows can't use 4 GB (though every other 32-bit OS can). 64-bit versions of Windows don't have much support for games, though (or anything for that matter).
