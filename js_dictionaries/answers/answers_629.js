At one point in the early 90s they were clearly the 2 best heavyweights in the world SSOO should have met but never did. Due mainly it has to be said to Bowe avoiding Lewis, he famously threw away the WBC belt at a press conference when the WBC ordered him to fight Lewis.Â ", 5304, "VIh5AliIaa", 1],

	35267 : ["No. Look he's a great fighter but when you look at some of his losses and the 3 he should have lost you gain some perspective on Pacquiao. Jeff horn, Bradley and singsurat were not world class fighters, all beat Pacquiao. Then there's the 4 fights with Marquez. The first if you judge properly, he lost. Second fight he was gifted by dodgy judges, same with the 3rd. The 4th he was knocked clean out. He's not top 10 ever, maybe top 20 at a push", 5298, "TdmTjKt8aa", -2],

That being said I still think he's one of the greatest defensive fighters ever, and I still rank him very high. Top 10 in his division? Absolutely. Top 5? Possibly yeah. Top 10 P4P? Also possible in my opinion. Top 5 P4P? Probably a stretch. I'm honestly convinced most of the people ranking him number one just wish they had his net worth. He's not messing with Sugar Ray Robinson.Â ", 5306, "lpU2dnqsaa", 0],
	35281 : ["Erm hard one. The only 3 top fighters he fought at their peak IMO were corrales, castillo and Hatton. So I'll knock him for that. However he did beat some really good fighters even if they were either underweight or a bit past it. The unbeaten thing I really don't rate as highly as a defeat isn't everything.

	35296 : ["I don't personally think he's the best ever but it's down to the quality of fighters. If you look most lists of the top 20 heavyweights of all time, Ali beat at least 3 of them (Frazer, Foreman, Liston, 4 if you include Ken Norton). The level of opposition Ali fought and beat is incredible. Very few fighters at any weight have faced that quality of opposition. Also throw in the way he beat some fighters. He knocked out Sonny Liston and George Foreman. Then there's the fact he's part of arguably the greatest fight of all time. The Thrilla in Manilla. Where I think a-lot of the claims ali is the greatest are down to his personality and the fact he was probably the first global megastar of the tv era. He's definitely top 3 ever (I personally put Joe Louis ahead).", 5309, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],
	35297 : ["Mostly casuals say he was the best boxer ever, one said it and so now everyone just says the same because they don't know anyone else apart from Mike Tyson.

Wlad had a weak chin. It was only later in his career he learned to cover that with a superior jab.. A youthful Wlad V Joshua goes the same way as the corrie sanders v wlad fight, 2 rounds and its over... Edit: miler as much as I agree with your sentiment on Joshua. Wlad was the same. See my answer.
