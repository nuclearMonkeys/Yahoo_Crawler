Seems people are more openly gay there.  I've always wondered how did they come up with the 10% figure. How would they know when so many gay people worldwide are still in the closet? What if you dont live in an open country like Canada or the UK? How did they know that 10% of Iraq, Saudi Arabia or Yemen is gay? Good question.

	97042 : ["I've read that many scientists and researchers put the number at ten percent of the global population - but that ten percent also includes bisexual and transgendered individuals, not such gay and lesbian people.  Personally I think the 10% estimate is rather conservative, I'd guess more around 15% based off the fact that people are born with their sexuality and how large the actually out GLBT community is.", 9605, "nUHkUdqQaa", 1],
	97043 : ["I certainly don't think it is less than 6%. There's studies which apparently show that 1.5% or less of the population are gay. Well just looking at my year group in my school, I've always thought there was around 360 people in my year, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was more like 300 now considering people have left. But half of 360 would be 180 which would be about the amount of boys, and 6% of that would be 10.8, let's say 11. Already, me and one other guy are out as gay, a further three that I know of are out as bi (and all three I suspect are actually gay), and that's already counting for half that figure. Remember I've used the 360 figure which is a bit more than is actually in our year. Most gay people don't come out in high school... apparently... So I would say there would be AT LEAST 5 other gay guys in our year. (I've got my suspicions on a few of them... my crush ;) If the 1.5% figure was true then that would mean 3 out of 180 guys in my year are gay or bi. Well there's already 5 of us out as gay/bi, and I'd say at least double that are still in the closet, so 1.5% seems WAY too low. I think 10% might be pushing it, but you never know. I wouldn't complain if 15% of people were gay. 0:)", 9605, "T0ak5SSsaa", -1],
