One who delves too deeply into the mysticism of astrology without seeking the perspectives that science has to offer can easily fall prey to those who wish to mislead.  There must be balance in all things, and the practice of astrology is no exception. You can listen to your instincts without negating logic.

It's not even me at all.\" I then have to explain that there is a Whole Long Drawn Out Affair To Astrology...Rising, Moon, Planets etc. Astrology has been around before the Grains of Time. Astrology even has your Physical aspects mapped out as well. Like Sagittarius usually have wider foreheads and Scorpio's tend to have more Pointier, beak like noses etc. That's fascinating. Or how Pisces have a thing about their feet and Scorpio's tend to have upper respiratory problems too etc. Astrology is our Guide for change and overcoming past Karma with ourselves and others. It shows us what we need to learn from...Our past and future conflicts. How to overcome those things and redirect them into a more positive way. It is our Guide. I'd Love to visit Egypt!

I'm worried if astrology is evil and is not of God, as I've always been interested in natal (birth data) astrology, rather than future-reading zodiac signs, and am tempted easily to look and research astrology books etc. Some things are surprisingly accurate, on a frequently high basis, such as people's personalities which often clash with mine. Is it co-incidence or not?

	88894 : ["People are referring to what they call astrology when skeptics, really mean horoscopes.  Horoscopes made for the masses mean nothing to the individual.  How could they?  They don't use your planets, or houses, or aspects.  They are just generalizations made in the assumption that you have today's Sun in your first house and then they put the planets in the corresponding houses.  That ain't me, is it you?  Of course not.** Now, as to bigotry or lack of responsibility.  Only the ignorant say they don't like someone based on being a certain sign, just as saying you don't like someone based on religion or skin color.  Astrology says that each one of us is a unique being who will not be duplicated for another 250,000 years. The combination of planets/ houses/ and aspects is so astronomical in number it amazes.  We also say that free will is basic to every person.  The chart does not command.  It merely points out easy connections and obstacles.  It will tell you how to maximize the good and how to conquer the difficult, but YOU have free will to accept or not. And if you accept, you may just have a lifelong assignment; sometimes the work isn't easy.  It definitely isn't for the lazy or the faint of heart.

Although the Moon's gravity does effect us -- LOOK HOW CLOSE IT IS!!!  None of the planets are close enough to have any effect on us. the STAR are much bigger, but also MUCH MUCH FARTHEr away.  THEY can have no effect on us, either. Astrology is now nothing more than a kids game. Adults use it to steal money from those poor people who are totally ignorant of science FACTS. The ONLY good thing astrology has done was to give ASTRONOMY a start.

When I tried and failed for YEARS, you'd think not only was I crazy, but also wrong. Then what would you think of the people who publish the news if I could somehow convince them to announce my predictions (which turn out to be wrong) every day?  They print horoscopes in the newspaper and online EVERY DAY. There's nothing correct about astrology.  It isn't based on anything real - the stars it was based on were grouped together simply because of how they looked, then the belief that this meant something came much later.  It's simply a superstitious belief.  There's nothing wrong with having them - you can't prove God exists, but for many people religion greatly enriches their lives all the same.

For example, in astronomy we do explain the zodiac. However the REAL zodiac is off by about a month from the \"astrology sign\" everyone \"has\". This is due to procession of the planet among other things.  It seems based on you're questions that you believe in it, and want \"proof\" that its wrong, when the only proof really is that astrology continues to get things wrong, refuses to change as astronomy changes, and if science disproves a part of what they believe, they come up with an explanation to say why its still correct.
