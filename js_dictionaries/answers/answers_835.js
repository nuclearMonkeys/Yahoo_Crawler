Yeah, well have a cookie, you broke the mystery. Microsoft has NOTHING to offer worth a damn the others can't get soon enough. Oh, \"HALO\", what year is this? Not to mention \"Fallout\"? Really, Bethesda ****** up and Microsoft bought the rights, hahaha. Sorry, but yeah. Nintendo Switch is awesome for adults also (I'm acting not much like one, but, I'm a REAL GAMER).

	46368 : ["All animals have a basic concept that they fear death that's why they run from being attacked!  I saw the YouTube petta ad where they load the pigs into the slaughterhouse and as they're loading the pigs into the chute there is workers beating the pigs with big plastic paddles that make a big noise.  It doesn't beat the pigs to death it gets the pig's blood to pumping it gets them excited so when they slash the pig's throat the pig bleeds out in a few seconds and they can dip it straight into the boiling water. The pig is often still squirming when they drop it into the scalding bath to remove the fur pretty much any commercial meat operation is very hard on the animals in its final minutes it's a big rush to kill the animal in a hurry. so they can kill another one so they can kill another one it is a chain!  The same thing happens in a chicken factory they grab the chicken by the legs stick a set of iron clamps on the chicken's legs and the chicken travels down the conveyor belt to a set of knives that chop off its head and then it gets mechanically cleaned and sent to people to package it in boxes. It is not necessary to cause pain discomfort and panic to the animal that you're going to eat. And beside that it ruins the flavor of the meat if you panic your food before you slaughter it it tastes like Africans underarms!  Have you ever ordered an Omaha steak they're delicious the meat is grain-fed and before the animal is slaughtered the animal was calmed down and petted and it doesn't even know what's happening when they shoot it in the head. That's why Omaha steak is so good the meat wasn't panicked before it was slaughtered. The stuff that you get in the store taste nothing like the meat that you get from a big steakhouse and that's why it's commercially slaughtered and the meat has been panicked. That characteristic nasty taste is really apparent.", 6604, "G225L5Tdaa", 1],
