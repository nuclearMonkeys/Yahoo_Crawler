So he was a good champ in my opinion, but probably the champ that I hated. The Cabinet, the fact he always retained by cheating. The fact he took the title off my favorite wrestler, Eddie Guerrero. Tons of stuff like that. So I only hated him because he wanted the fans to hate him, so he did a nice job. But if you mean current champ, the Miz. He hasn't defended the title for a while and I hate that. He is killing the U.S. title's prestige. EDIT: @Biohazard and Dubian MoJo. Cool. My birthday is on the 26 too. In fact, August 26. Hahaha.

	68249 : ["Glad he finally is talking as if he is seeing the light.  Unfortunately, Obama's sincerity is to question at this point.  Also, the biggest problem causing the dollar to crash is overspending by Congress, and he has the most expensive plan for spending of all candidates.  I'd like to see what he really plans in spending cuts.  The war doesn't count since we were starting to slide even before those costs, and without his new programs.  Besides, he just wants to shift troops to Afghanistan and Iran, as is now clear, so there won't really be savings. Here's a good discussion of the dollar issue: Ron Paul, of course, is the one who has been saying this all along, predicting what has happened before it happened.  He is the one who called for and obtained this week's hearings tying the dollar falling to the price of oil, as well.  However, I only wish I at this point thought Obama taking an interest actually meant anything.  I really think he'll just say anything to win, after FISA and his flip on Iran.

	68255 : ["No, disagreeing with the president is not racist. There are plenty of legit complaints. However, arguments like: Birth Certificate, calling him \"not American\", secret muslim, etc. are definitely racist. In addition, harbouring an extreme rage at everything he does for no real reason is probably indicative of a racist attitude as well. There are also a pile of arguments that are just stupid, like \"socialism\", czars, and a couple of others. Since racists tend to use these as well, if you use them, you might be confused for a racist. Sorry, no pity.

	68256 : ["There are actually some racists on here, right?  And perhaps sometimes people get it wrong about who is racist, but many times they are right.  If you had experienced racism against you, you would find it's not that hard to spot. I do believe that many racists do not realize that's what they are feeling.  They truly believe they are upset about Obama's birth certificate or “death panels” in the health care bill.  But let me tell you that I have worked on many, many political campaigns in my life, some very hard-fought, and I have never seen this type of vitriol and anger and hatred directed at a president this early in his administration.   Do you ever wonder why no one ever worried about a flag pin, a guy's minister, his birth certificate or his religion before in our country's history?  Do you?  Because a lot of people look at that type of stuff and think it's racism, and they could be right.  Or it could just be politics--a concerted effort to discredit Obama and diminish his presidency. Having said that, there is nothing whatsoever wrong with disagreeing with his policies.  If you posted “I don't like this health reform bill because...” no one would call you racist.  How could they?  But I have seen posts like “Michelle Obama is a gorilla,” “Should we rename the White House to the Black House,” and much, much worse, including “Does Michelle defecate on her pizza and then eat it?” and “There should not be a n*i*g*g*e*r in our White House.”  What do you make of those posts?  Do you denounce them, disagree with them or ever let the poster know they are unacceptable?  Because we don't see any regular conservatives denouncing this type of crap either, which makes it seem like you think it is OK. So disagree with his policies all you want.  But when you treat this president in an entirely different way than any other president has ever been treated, don't be surprised if some of us notice that the main difference between Obama and all the other presidents is his skin color.", 8451, "None", 1],

How many times has Harry Reid and others called Bush a liar, stupid, etc. with no chastising?  And the reason that Obama may not have been lying about illegals getting healthcare is because he plans on giving them all amnesty before the bill passes.

	68262 : ["There are two typical ways of getting MP3s onto your computer. You either download them from some website, or you get them from a regular (store-bought or borrowed) CD. But wait! there's a third way, and it's great if you have a ton of old vinyl sitting around unplayed, and you want to take those old scratchy classics along with your iPod.  Here's how you can convert your vinyl-to-MP3: If you're like me, you've got hundreds of old albums sitting around collecting dust. Or maybe you've got several dozen cassette collections from the 70s, 80s or early 90s. You hardly every get them out, unless you're totally bored or you have an old song busting through your head, like \"She's A Lover\" by the Pretty Things, Grand Funk Railroad's \"T.N.U.C.\" or \"Baby Talks Dirty\" by The Knack and you just gotta hear it. Now. So you pull out the album, play the song and stick it back in. Now wouldn't it be easier if the song was just sitting on your computer as an MP3, and you just had to click a mouse a few times? All you really need to accompany your computer and sound card is a line-in recording device and a piece of software to accompany it. Equipment-wise, you'll need an RCA to 1/8” headphone jack cable and an MP3 encoder that gives you the option of recording any audio from your line-in. Check out Musicmatch or RealOne Rhapsody. They're sufficient, although if you want to do any more serious recording with some spiffier controls and options, you'll want to look into something like Cool Edit Pro 2.0 (now Adobe's Audition) or Sound Forge. Still, the low-end versions will accomplish what you want – getting the audio into your computer to convert that old vinyl-to-MP3. Connect the output of your stereo amplifier to the back of your computer. And again, if you're looking at doing this more than casually, you'll want to look at getting a small mixing board, such as a Mackie Mixer for around $240. It gives you a number of inputs, and more control over your volume, balance, bass, treble, etc. If all you have is your cassette deck, for instance, just hook the output of that into the sound card of your computer. In MusicMatch, select the desired bitrate for your MP3s. For most uses, the near CD-quality of 128 Kbps will work. If you're like me, and want to make it a little higher quality – in case The Knack means that much to you – try 160bps or 192bps. It'll take up a little more room, but hard drives are so cheap, don't hold back on account of scrimping for space. Hey, these are precious recordings! Now, browse your menu (most likely under options), and set the recorder source to Line In. To set your recording level, play the cassette or record and open up your computer's Recording Control. (You'll find that under Control Panel > Sounds and Audio Devices). Drag your mouse up or down on the slider to adjust the recording volume. You'll have to listen back to the recording to check out the volume before you're satisfied that it's not too quiet or overmodulated (recorded so loud the sound distorts). One of the tricks at this point in playing back your test recording is to find the darn song! I always have a little trouble finding it. To see where it landed on your hard drive, go to Options > Settings > Recorder and check the Tracks Directory. This way you can see the path and sub-paths to where the song is stored on your hard drive. To listen, navigate to File > Open and go to the directory where your song or test is recorded. Once you've decided you like it the sound level and quality, go back and start another recording. You're well on your way to creating MP3s of your vintage vinyl tidbits and precious and rare recordings. Then your records will be safe while the digitized version can be played over and over, shared with friends, or taken with you on your portable MP3 device. Even if you aren't into The Pretty Things.", 8455, "AA11296713", 79],

Top conservative leadership in this country is feeling much more comfortable with Obama these days. It's a real juggling act for Obama - to keep the support of the conservatives in one hand while juggling with the support of his liberal base in the other hand. He seems to be doing it so far.

	68275 : ["Hey Riley, From the inside, you may feel like you “failed at life”. From the outside, you appear to be a winner, & a descendent of a very long line of winners. There's NEVER been anyone like you. You are a precious gift to the world, a unique combination of human genes & life experiences, an unparalleled concentration of knowledge, opinions, & attitudes, the like of which has never existed before. You have what all those billions of animals, plants & funghi alive beside you lack – a human consciousness, & a good 65 years ahead of you to do with it whatever you will. All your ancestors were winners too, because they bore & raised offspring that all contributed to your unique genome. I've lived with bipolar disorder for three decades, so I know how difficult it can be at times of deep depression to accept that these ideas apply to you, or to me. But just think back on your ancestry – 4 billion years of life forms exploring the possibilities of what being alive can mean, 2.5 million years of humans acquiring ever greater humanity, 200,000 years of people like you succeeding in being human, countless generations of life on Earth culminating right here & now in your good self. If you could ask those ancestors of yours “Have I failed at life at 20?”, don't you think they'd all say, “NO – you have NOT!” & tell you all the things you have to live for, drawing on their life experiences?  You are already applying your birthright intelligence to the issues you face, but I recognise how the depressive mindset you are currently in is skewing you view of your future. Remember – “This too shall pass”, all mood states are temporary, & in the future you will be able to look back at this despairing episode & identify when & how it ended. For instance, let's say, like me and many others, you come to regard higher education as a human right & a social necessity, not a privilege for the rich or a burden on the clever – so you figure out how to go to university, discover that this experience turns your mood state around, & you ace a job interview, landing a start in a fulfilling career. Or you choose to claim your human right to free education by moving house in such a way that your university loan provider cannot locate you ever again, & begin a fresh debt-free well-educated life, like so many young people do.  None of us can choose where we come from – parents, step-parents, socio-economic background, etc. – but all of us get to choose where we're going. Sometimes you may justifiably feel that the where-you-come-from is a real pain-in-the-a$$ (eg: your step mom's cruelty, my mom passing me bipolar genes), BUT... you “didn't want to leave behind my friends & real mom's side of the family”. That ***IS*** you getting to choose the best possible company on your journey through life. THEY ARE the people you can confide in, who also see the winner in you, & who can give you all the love & support you need on your journey. Trust them, open up to them with honesty & integrity, cry on their shoulders, & welcome in their love & support, because you absolutey deserve it. No doubt opportunities will arise for you to pay such love & support forward, too – to these people, or to folk who befriend you in the future. Loving & supporting each other is what we humans do best for each other, & oftentimes all you have to do is ask, or let your need be known. You seem clear that one big issue for you is social anxiety disorder (SAnD), which is a great leap forward. Without knowing this, you'd “only have yourself to blame”. My bipolar disorder went undiagnosed for 10 years, but diagnosis not only lifted the “you only have yourself to blame” false burden, but opened up a world of possibilities. Evidence-based medical practice knows about social anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, & many others ways to be human – & can help us in discovering ways to minimise the affect on our lives. You can apply that birthright intelligence of yours to that discovery process, on the web, in books & documentaries, & in your community – & your question here on Y!A is proof that you can do so, since it's attracted great answers from others with SAnD like Jaycee & Wena Redbeard. Stepping back a while for a wider perspective, we can see that in reality there are no winners & losers – those are merely tentative, temporary, subjective human judgement calls, not absolute facts of nature. For instance, Donald Trump might regard you as a loser, & a person in absolute starvation level poverty might regard you as a winner, but neither opinion is absolutely right or wrong. There are the alive & the dead. We share the former, & my hope is that it'll stay that way, until you outlive me. A human consciousness is the greatest possible gift the universe can bestow on matter that we know of – please cherish yours with care & kindness, for as long & fulfilling a life as possible.
