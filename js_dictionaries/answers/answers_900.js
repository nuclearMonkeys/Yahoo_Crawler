	50100 : ["0x0E - 0xFF is NOT +15. It is -241. Do not confuse two, completely unrelated, problems. * Hexadecimal * Representation of negative number. Claiming 0x0E-0xFF=+15 is exactly (really exactly) the same thing as saying \"14-255=15\". The only reason why people don't see how obviously false it is when using hexa, and see it when using decimal, is just because we do a mental confusion with \"hexa -> low level\" and \"low level -> -15 and 241 has the same 8 bit representation\". So In hexa substraction is done exactly like in decimal  0x0E -0xFF -------- FF is bigger than 0E, so do the reverse subtraction and add a minus sign FF-0E F-E=1, no carry. Last digit of result is 1. F-0=F, no carry. First digit is F. No other computation So 0x0E-0xFF = -0xF1 A more complex example  0x2A5 -0x18B ---------- 5-B = -6, which is negative. So add 10 (0x10) and carry 1. Last digit is 0x5-0xB+0x10 = 0xA A-8-1 (-1 because of previous carry) is 1. 2-1=1 So 3 digits of the result are 11A ======================== So subtraction in hexa is just a subtraction, like in all other bases. a-b is -(b-a) (which is how you compute it if b is bigger than a). a - (-b) is a+b. Etc. And to compute it by hand, you just perform digit per digit subtraction from right to left, sometimes carrying a 1. Exactly like you do in base 10. A completely unrelated matter is the fact that, on a computer, with limited bits to represent integers, you can represent only a given different numbers. On 8 bits, you can represent only 256 different values. There are different choices of mapping between the 256 possible combination of eight 0 or 1, and 256 integers values. The most commons are the unsigned binary one (00000000 -> 0, 00000001 -> 1, ..., 01111111 -> 127, 10000000 -> 128, 10000001 -> 129, ...,  11111110 -> 254, 11111111 -> 255) and the signed one (00000000 -> 0, 00000001 -> 1, ..., 01111111 -> 127, 10000000 -> -128, 10000001 -> -127, ..., 11111110 -> -2, 11111111 -> -1) Advantage of that signed representation is that, for lot of operations, it is transparent for the processor. Processor doesn't need to know whether a packet of 8 bits represent a signed or unsigned value to perform the operation. Result will be the same, and interpretation is up to the user. 10000001 + 00000001 = 10000010 whatever. It is up to you to interpret that as meaning 129 + 1 = 130 or meaning -127 + 1 = -126. Both are true anyway, but from an electronic point of view, it is the same 10000001+00000001=10000010 computation) But that leads to the fact that 129 and -127 have the same representation (depending on whether you choose to interpret 10000001 as signed or unsigned). 130 and -126 also. And, in your case, 1 and 255 also. -241 and +15 also. That is true even in hexa. 0xFF and 0x01 have the same 8 bits representation. So do -0xF1 and 0x0F. The only reason why you are most used to see it in hexa, is because of a coincidence : the cases when you may want to say \"-0xF1 and 0x0F have the same 8 bits representation\" happens to be the same as those when you may want to use hexadecimal : when you are interested in memory content of a computer, bytes by bytes. In an algebra lesson you would never bother to talk about 8 bits representation of numbers. Nor would you use hexadecimal basis. But that is just a coincidence. Hexa is the basis we most often use to talk about bytes values. And talking about 8 bits representation of numbers is talking about bytes values. So, bottom line. 14-255 = 0x0E-0xFF = -0xF1 = -241 And, yes, 255 happens to have the same 8 bits representation as -1. -241 the same 8 bits representation as 15. So, that arithmetic operation is the same for a CPU as 14-(-1) = 0x0E-(-0x01) = 0x0F = 15 Note that you have to choose, tho. You can't choose to interpret half of the 8 bits numbers as signed one, and the other as unsigned one. Or else you are doomed to say silly things such as 14-255 = +15 (or, 0x0E-0xFF=0x0F)", 7049, "d3cd3e0f2e8feaaff79363574632bf96aa", 2],
