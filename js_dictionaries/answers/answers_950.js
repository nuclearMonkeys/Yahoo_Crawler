I don't care one flying fig if my kid, nor anyone else's, nor any adult for that matter is singing and/or bopping along to whatever music is playing in the store. I think it's just fine for even children to have basic social skills and the ability to greet someone (heaven forbid they learn how to care for others!). Sometimes... just to piss people like you off... I give my son his own list and he *gasp* touches items to put them in the cart! But, then, other times, I take advantage of grandma inviting him over and I go to the store alone and if I don't want to interact with anyone, I put my earbuds in and listen to my own music--- and probably wind up singing along. ", 7414, "8HoGFOxraa", -2],

Mick is cool. Simon -5/10 Nothing wrong with it, just not a name I enjoy.  Jason -5/10 Not a favourite of mine either. Screams ‘80s. I also associate it strongly with Jason Vorhees. Alex -7/10 If used as a nickname for Alexander, I like it. Alexander is a handsome, formal name that's very versatile with all its nicknames. I also happen to love Alex Jones. Infowars.com. Check it out! Roman -8/10 I've always liked this name. It also has a classy sound but is fairly uncommon...so far. Miles -4/10 I'm not into it, but I don't think it's stupid or ugly.

Girls at the start of puberty, tend to have raging mood swings, and can go 0-60 ina snap, even if shes not displaying outward developments, in her brain the hormones are already changing. 2- Stressors: Her entire life has been tipped on its side over the past year or so! She's dealing with her parents divorcing, the aspect of her father being involved with someone else who isn't her mother, moving out of the only house she's ever known, switching schools, as well as the covid pandemic. That's a lot for an adult to deal with,  now stop and think that this is a girl barely out of diapers, that is being asked to deal with ALL of those changes in such a short frame. You say she's fine? I don't buy it! Have you actually sat down with her and asked her how SHE is doing with all these changes? Odds are you haven't, and given she's a child, she a) doesn't know how to process things at an adult level and b) she wants the approval of BOTH her parents, so odds are,she's trying to bury it, and put on a fake front. What I think needs to happen? You and your ex need to get on the same page here, you BOTH need to have an honest discussion about where your daughters head is at, and then come up with an action plan on how best to help her navigate through all these changes going on in her life. ", 7415, "NaSgrh7Haa", 0],
	52987 : ["So your daughter had a meltdown in public, because the pain of what she's been through over the past year or so finally caught up with her. You might THINK that she was adjusting well to your being out of her life and then taking up with someone new, but all you really could see was what was on the surface- and kids that age are usually masters at letting parents see only what they think the parent wants to see. They're good at hiding their real feelings, and the truth is that your daughter hasn't had a chance to process all the changes and the fact that you've basically disappeared from her life. I'm sure she probably feels you don't love her anymore, and that she may blame herself because you and her mom aren't together anymore. Most children of divorce generally do that. I know, because I was your daughter's age when MY parents split up- and within a year of that time, my dad moved more than a thousand miles away to another country, and I went from seeing him every week to seeing him once a year if I was lucky. Then he remarried when I was 10- and my new stepmother was anything but friendly. So I understand where your daughter is coming from, because I've been there. She's MAD at you, pal. Really, really MAD. Mad at you for deserting her and her mom, and mad at you for rejecting her. You have a LOT of fences to mend with her, and the way to start is by making a point of spending time ALONE with her, and giving her your undivided attention. You need to learn how to talk to her on HER level, not your own. As for the meltdown, your daughter didn't just suddenly decide to act up- she's been in pain- very real PAIN, for months, if not years- and it just got to be too much for her.The meltdown could have happened anywhere- it just happened to occur when you were at the carnival. I had that happen to me when I was her age, too. It took me YEARS to understand that my parents had divorced each other, and not me- and even more YEARS to accept that my dad was gone and was never coming back. Your daughter isn't old enough or mature enough yet to be able to express her anger and pain in a constructive, adult manner, but that doesn't mean she doesn't FEEL IT. She also isn't mature enough to understand why you and her mom can't be together anymore.It will take time and a lot of patience and hard work on your part to help her understand that what has happened isn't her fault and that you still love her. And I would COOL it with your girlfriend for a while. Seriously, I would. Having a stranger around isn't helping your situation, and I am sure that your daughter is also jealous of her.", 7415, "None", 2],

C's is where she should be. That's all she needs. If she's getting better than that - even a C+ - she's excelling. I have a son who does mountain biking and he loves that but gets average grades at school. My daughter does netball in Div 3, theatre, music, and gets A's at school, but on the occasion she gets lower than that and is down about it I make sure she knows that as long as she puts in the effort and behaves it's okay. My son has great friends who help him whenever he's struggling, so as long as you support her and make sure she surrounds herself with great friends it should be fine. Don't pressure her. That's the worst thing you could do and it will distance you from her.And never - NEVER - call your daughter stupid. That's horrible and the absolute OPPOSITE of the kind of parent you should try to be. Stupid? No. She is not stupid. Always remember that. And all children (almost especially smart ones who get bored of class easily and face high expectations and pressure) have off days where they can't focus - gosh, sometimes my daughter comes home and when I ask her how class was she says, \"Oh, I just watched anime all class.\" (This happens a lot in Maths on rainy days).Finally, since I can see you've been getting a lot of hate (including from me), it's okay, She's only Grade 6 now, right?

We also had given our son the instruction that he was free to defend himself in any way necessary (he does have a black belt in karate and his training actually prevented him from fighting back), and that if any kid laid a hand on him, we would be filing a police report.

Or they will criticize the religions they have the most \"personal beef\" with, like a past of being forced into a religion. Doesn't make that much sense and is kind of nasty because many religions do the same things like that and are not really looking at the bigger picture, but oh well.  3. Especially, if they were forced to go to church while young, they may have learned about the religion. Since they have knowledge, it is easier to criticize certain religions over others.  4. Also, it seems to criticize Muslims is to discriminate against them and it seems a lot of atheists are liberals, so they do not want to be seen as discriminatory.  The whole thing I think is that if you are going to criticize, criticize the religion/certain parts of the religion. Do not criticize \"Muslims\" or \"Christians\" because you do not know them personally. I do not know how atheists act in parts of the world other than the USA, but it is definitely true that atheists in US are less likely to criticize Muslims and other less popular/powerful religions in US, because they are looking at the smaller picture and probably have something personal with more popular religions.", 7402, "FxA07Ys0aa", -1],
