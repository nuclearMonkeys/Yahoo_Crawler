	65546 : ["Hi there, my name is Sir Penguin, and I'd like to be your question answerer today. First off, this question requires some clarification, because Newts can \"technically\" not run for office, unless they are running for office within the Newt Community.  So I will assume that your question refers to a Newt running for a political election within the Newt Community. Secondly, there are no really elections within the Newt Community, as they are a Theocratic Monarchy, in which the King Newt and the Queen Newt are elected by God.  So I will assume that you mean in how many states God will pick a King or Queen Newt to pick from in 2012. Thirdly, there are no real \"states\" within the Newt Community, as they operate under a hegemonic prefecture system of administrative regions.  This is a relic of the feudally-organized Proto-Newt Civilization, which ended around 1301 C.E. (common era).  So I would assume that you mean 45 or 47 prefectures. Fourthly, the year 2012 is three years in the future, and the average Newt has a life expectancy of around 2.61 years.  However, some individuals might be able to live for 3.1 years.  I would assume you mean Newt Gingrich, however, and since it appears that this Newt is already alive, the chances of Newt Gingrich surviving into 2012 C.E. (common era) is highly unlikely. In conclusion: no.", 8297, "1DT4DdYbaa", 2],
	65547 : ["You're delusional. In the 90's, Gingrich was so disliked, that Democrats ended up winning against their opponents just by connecting them to Newt Gingrinch. Almost nobody likes Newt Gingrich, I don't think even most Republicans are that enthusiastic about him.", 8297, "None", 2],
	65548 : ["You he is being trained now, but they have a plan for victory in 100 or 200 years so please get off his back!!! Ohh he is looking for directions on how to get it Iran", 8299, "None", 0],
	65549 : ["Disastrous? The overthrow of a vicious dictator was disastrous?  Hmm. Offering aid to a government wanting to adopt democracy.  Disastrous? Disastrous would be to raise the white flag and cut and run.", 8299, "vujM41i6aa", -5],

	65554 : ["He should have just said poor. But he was trying to reach that hateful racist crowd. The Republicans don't care about the racial tone. They've run on this issue forever. Things are different now for most of us. But there are millions out there that will never change. Its Deep seeded", 8295, "None", 1],
	65555 : ["He might have been brought up that way, I know I have slipped more than once on the ''Black people'' card, or the other racism cars, but I know that if he is sorry, and not racist, or wants to get elected president, he will probably show up on the tele apologizing.", 8295, "1MVpfIfdaa", -2],
	65556 : ["I have heard that the October surprise will be Mitt's long form birth certificate that was found in the hall of records in Mexico City proving that he was born in Chihuahua. They will show the records of his 5 sister wives that were eliminated so that they couldn't tell the truth about him. Edit Progressives have a very short memory. It was the Clinton's that attacked Obama about his birth certificate. The republicans have been mocking them since 2008. It is funny to see how angry they still get about it.", 8296, "p5TQqjFKaa", 1],
	65557 : ["He should only because Republicans called on Obama to and thus I hope, if he hasn't already, he does. Otherwise, people should be asked to by law. It was wrong to ask Obama simply on grounds that he looked a different color for that was racism. I am not an Obama supporter but I knew he was born in the USA long before he released the birth certificate. I also know Romney was born in the USA as was George Romney. The article says his father was born in Mexico, but it must have been referring to his grandfather, for his father was a US presidential candidate and thus born in the USA.", 8296, "None", -1],
	65558 : ["To the respondents who say that he served his spouse divorce papers on her deathbed, provide up listening to conversing heads do your guy or woman learn. It has in spite of the undeniable fact that, been shown, that John Edwards, one among your liberals had an affair (and probable a new child) jointly as his spouse is dying of terminal maximum cancers - you should examine Elizabeth Edward's e book. i desire Gingrich does run - he's ten cases smarter (not in trouble-free terms a wordsmith) and greater savvy than every person else on the scene - on all factors", 8297, "Ey1W0PfIaa", 0],

	65563 : ["just look at the sites like go daddy.com about to expire due to claim domain name not renewed and say well maybe send to public library if concerned. seems people expect to be paid for domain names .and if willing to that means green marxism in support of black  members of community viable matters only people who want free stores help support party. votes are enough though. course go daddy.com is game site .i wonder though is messages servers are forbidden are racist or if people making point about games sites jerking people around saying web page does not exist maybe putting ad for that here fixes the problem . no not spamming", 8295, "HHursjYRaa", -4],

	65565 : ["He was making a joke about the birthers and how no one has asked for his birth certificate.  I am sure if anyone wants to see it he will bring it out and make another joke about it. I found it funny that Obama's people jumped on it saying that Romney was giving credibility to the birthers.  Really?  He was making a joke about them and Obama took it personally.  What a narcissist Obama is.", 8296, "pWhAXJ7xaa", -1],
	65566 : ["Who cares, same goes for tax record...  I know he was born in the US, the same way I know he has billions socked away in off shore accounts and investments to prevent them from being taxed.", 8296, "a99fa88fee7bee5c703d53159e8c1e80aa", -1],
	65567 : ["newt could probably be listening to the groovis sound, listening to the tracks he's laying down, newt is coming up from the ground and he's got a message that he has found - gonna keep winning states", 8297, "None", 3],
	65568 : ["No, he would not.  No one can.   Can you quickly respond to this?  Sounds like you support Gingrich.  Why him and Not Romney?  Romney passed HC reform in MASS and he has very good economic experience.  He turned a deficit into a surplus.", 8297, "1TYbGZ3Paa", -1],

	65570 : ["When I was little I cut my bangs off. I look like someones beaten step child lol. Was funny looking. All my kid pics my hair is a little messed up. When I was younger I cut my own bangs a lot. Now I cut my families hair sometimes. I do a pretty good job too.", 8299, "piE8mQM3aa", 1],

	65585 : ["They are very serious. Newts the only one so far that has no problem with getting into Obamas face and challenging some of his decisions and policies.

	65586 : ["The Republican establishment -- no. they know him for the loathsome, disingenuous creep that he is. The Tea Bagger and fundamentalist Christian Republicans (go figure) are serious about Newt--Apparently serial infidelity isn't a deal breaker among the \"family values\" crowd! . In the end the establishment will win out as Newt will implode as he always does.
