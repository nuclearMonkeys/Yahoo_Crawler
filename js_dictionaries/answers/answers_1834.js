	97447 : ["The answer is history.  There was a time when schools were openly segregated.  There were white schools and black schools, just as there were white water fountains and black water fountains.  Even after segregation was officially stopped, it was a slow process.  Google \"stand in the schoolhouse door\" to get an understanding of this.  The ongoing racism caused many students of color to prefer a school where they would not be the minority, where they would not be seen as exceptions, where they would not be seen as special cases.  They found this at schools that had previously been only for blacks, such as Howard University. Howard now freely admits students regardless of race, but their history as a school for blacks attracts many black students who find some serious racism that still exists in our system.

	97477 : ["Okay, first, to be fair, you need to know that I have a thing for Dave Gahan, and Corbijn has directed scads of their videos. I would watch Gahan buy his groceries or do his laundry, so those probably need to be discounted out of hand, since I can't be objective about them.  I think my favorite is probably \"Electrical Storm\" by U2. I like that Larry Mullen finally gets some face time, and I really like the mermaid and the water. Corbijn has a good eye, like all directors should, and it's a really beautiful video. The fact that he works a lot in B&W was of great benefit in this particular video, because you don't really pay attention to the motion of water when you can see the color. The lack of color makes the water look stunning. At 4:09 there's also a tiny bit of brilliance where the firework goes off behind her, and gives her a halo of sorts. The whole thing is wonderful. BQ: Currently my favorite music video is this one: \"Darling, It's Alright\" by Francis and the Lights--I may grow out of this, since I just discovered them recently, and I'm still obsessed. At 1:52 it just goes from good to...some superlative I don't know. BQ2: \"The Killing Moon.\" It's been my favorite since I first heard it, but in general, I do love Echo and the Bunnymen.
