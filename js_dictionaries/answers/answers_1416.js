I have contacted my Senators and Representative once so far; telling them what I liked, what seemed unclear, and what parts I disagree with. The health care reform bill is massive; it is a lot to read. I'm glad that Congress has not rushed it through the legislative process.  Can you, or anyone answering this question, clarify something for me? When you say \"NO, to government run health care\"; do you include Medicare? Also; which part of the bill (HR3200) do you think is government run health care?", 8846, "SfGyzMSFaa", 2],
	76414 : ["I appreciate the link to contact my congressional representative.  Please don't get offended but I want to tell you that I am on the other side in this issue.  I'm in favor of providing a health care plan  for every US citizen.  I think it is so unfair for some of us to be covered by health insurance and then deny that same benefit to others.  Too many of my relatives and friends are among the working poor who do not have health insurance.  They only receive medical treatment at the hospital ER when disaster strikes.  Also, I realize I would be uninsurable myself if my husband lost his group health insurance through his employer.  This is a big issue that affects everyone.  I'm so glad we live in a democracy where everyone gets a vote on the subject.", 8846, "7fHsyHYraa", 3],

With the young pitching they have some strong arms to build around. This is only helping you for the future. They'll learn and the experience is great. This series though there just out matched. The Red Sox are on fire right now. With the offense rolling like it is, for the most part the bullpen has been lights out, of course except for Okijima tonight. The starting pitching has been at its best all year. I think tonight was a huge game to see how the Sox would handle playing in Colorado, which I think they hushed all the critics. Just like the Rockies were hot there in the DS and CS, the Sox are on a pretty good role themselves. You also have to remember that the Rockies sat around for 8 days. I was watching the post game show and Harold Renyolds had a really good point. Not saying good or bad but something to think about. He mentioned the few substitutions you made, a few of those guys have not been in a game since the late division series and early championship series so some of those guys were put into a situation and they have not played for almost 2 weeks. You sit around for 2 weeks and play a team whos been playing right along thats gotta be tough.  with that being said I def have alot more respect for the rockies coming from last year to this year, these past 2 games have been pretty interesting, give them a year or 2", 8851, "None", 1],

Like that game in 1996 when the Rockies were down 6-5 in the bottom of the 9th with two outs, Dante Bichette on first and Ellis Burks at the plate.  He hit a deep fly ball and it looked like it would be a homer, but the ball was caught at the warning track and the Rockies lost.  That was really sad!  I felt for Rockies fans that day and every day since! And to you Red Sox fans, don't even bring up your World Series championship drought anymore!  You are about to win your second World Series in the last four years.  I don't know if anyone in Red Sox Nation gets this, and I'll probably get 20 thumbs down from angry Red Sox fans, but to the rest of the country the Red Sox are the new Yankees.

In fact, the enactment of prohibition was the 18th constitutional amendment. This was out from the 19th constitutional amendment, women's suffrage, by only a couple of months.
