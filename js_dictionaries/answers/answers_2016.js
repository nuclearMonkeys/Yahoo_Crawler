You musn't even think about using reason or even treading on this mechanism of supporting your beliefs---you simply have no support from here (reason).  You're wasting time and efforts and you will likely get sidetracked.  If you're a believer, just simply----believe.  Don't turn your attention to all these usually negative arguments regarding faith and how evidence can't help.  Well, it's a fact that it can't so just accept that and move on.

	106597 : ["E11 is a specific model of Bb Clarinet made by a specific company (Buffet) -- the same way that an Escalade is a specific sort of automobile made by Cadillac. Buffet clarinets are very good instruments.  The quality control is exceptional and they are pretty easy to find someone to work on.  The E11 isn't the best of the Buffet models but it's a very-very good advanced student instrument that will last most people through middle school, high school, and college (for marching band in college - not studio performance).  It's also a suitable instrument for professional sax players who need a clarinet for doubling.  The tolerances of the manufacturing process are very fine and it's actually a useable instrument for professionals who need a backup for outdoor playing or questionable venues where you don't take a $3500+ R13. When you look at those ads that say \"approved\" on them - call them and ask \"approved by whom?\"  -- there's no approval agency for band instruments.  In fact, I could put a garden hose with a clarinet mouthpiece on it on eBay and call it \"approved\" if I want to. Fingerings:  YES, some do indeed have a different fingering system and you'll want to make certain that you're buying the right one.  In the USA we use the Boehm system exclusively but that's not the case in the rest of the world. Better sound:  Some.  The real difference in sound quality comes at a much higher price than an E11.  Take a look at the Buffet R13 -- now that's a sound quality difference.  It's also why most professional players use an R13 or similar model instrument. What's the \"Bb\"?:  In the USA we use a Bb Soprano Clarinet in school instrumental music programs.  Most instruments sold as \"clarinet\" are in fact a Bb Soprano Clarinet.  The \"Bb\" part simply means that the fundamental pitch of the closed/natural tube sounds a Bb when played and we all use the same thing so that we can play together and not sound bad.  There are others though and they have particular uses.  Orchestras use an A clarinet in addition to the Bb.  Opera uses the C and D often.  Many bands have a single Eb (aka \"ee'fer\", a tiny clairnet) player.  In some eastern and ethnic music they use a G clarinet.  None of these are suitable for a band class even though some will cost far more than a standard Bb soprano.  [If you're buying for a college/university player then you might as well get used to the idea of buying a matching A Clarinet sooner or later too.] The most common reason that a music teacher will insist on a particular model of a particular maker is to be certain everyone in the class is on equal footing and because it's easier to get repairs made when you have a common need.  There are other models by companies such as Selmer, Yamaha, Leblanc, Jupiter, etc that are equal to an E11, they just won't cost you much (if any) less.  Where you find prices lower, you also find lower specifications and quality.  Requiring an E11 though is an awful high model demand for school music.  I'd expect to see that as the very minimum (not suggested model) of a college/university clarinet studio or an ensemble that is performing at the highest level of high school performance such as the All-State honors ensemble.  The Buffet B12 is their student/beginner model and it's A LOT less expensive. If you think of it in terms of tools; while you can build a birdhouse with some tools you got down at the Dollar Store; would you want to try to build a house for people to live in or work on your car's brakes with those tools?  You'd probably want some much better made for that purpose.  A musical instrument is a tool too.  Some are cheap pieces of garbage that nobody could ever be expected to play well on - others are massive overkill that will do things none of us will ever need to do.  In the middle you find a range such as the Buffet E11 or R13.", 9964, "zCOvQwQhaa", 3],

Nor do prestigious and well - known preachers do, either. Because we are Human. Lol. But DO think about where you would like to be as far as personal values and goals are concerned.
