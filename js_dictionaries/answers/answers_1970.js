	104253 : ["This is an interesting question, because long ago (back in the 60's!) there was a story where Superman had to wear a different constume.  Basically, Luthor disguised himself as a scientist and asked to borrow Superman's indestructible costume for an experiment.  He said was developing an atomic powered robot and was afraid the engine might explode, so could the robot wear the suit for the test, and that way if it exploded, the super suit could contain the blast and nobody would be harmed. Superman didn't think of using his x-ray vision to see if the sceintist was someone else in disguise (!) so he agreed. He loaned the 'scientist' the suit and wore something else during the test.  The robot exploded, the 'scientist' said, Oh well, back to the drawing board, here's your suit, at least nobody got hurt, thanks anyway. And he gave Superman a FAKE super suit. Next thing you know, bullets were making holes in Superman's suit and the colors were running in the rain! So he went back to the scientist and said What happened to my suit? Luthor had an explanation ready; he said the atomic explosion changed the suit so it was no longer indestructible. He offered to make Superman a new suit. The new one had all sorts of bells and whistles. It had a radio receiver in it, so Superman could hear police broadcasts. It had miniature wings on the boots so he could fly silently. It had gloves so he wouldn't leave fingerprints behind. It was flourescent green, so people could see Superman from a long distance away and know that he was on the way to help. And it had a special belt that was an emergency device that would 'save' Superman's life.  So Superman got used to appearing in public in his new suit, and Luthor kept the old one to secretly impersonate Superman. The secret device on the belt turned out to be Kryptonite in a lead capsule with a timer and some acid; when Luthor wanted to pimpersonate Superman the timer released the acid which ate through the lead and exposed him to the Kryptonite so he got weak, but Jimmy Olsen helped Superman beat Luthor.  When he was beaten, Luthor got angry and asked Superman how he figured out there was Kryptonite hidden in his belt. The thing is, Superman DIDN'T figure it out, and had to trick Luthor into telling him! So that time Luthor himself saved Superman. Superman took back his original suit and gave Luthor a prison suit and put the 'new' suit in his Fortress. It was a good story, but I always wanted to see one where he lost his powers and had to use the 'new' suit again until they came back. Anyhow, if Superman wore the Iron Man armor, he wouldn't be Superman, he would be Superman posing as Iron Man. What does he need armor for, anyhow? The only time Superman ever wore armor is when he needed lead armor to protect him from Kryptonite, and then he had to have a closed circuit tv inside so he didn't have eye holes that the radiation could get through. And even then, the bad guys saw him wearing the armor and they hit him with a rocket propelled grenade. BOOM! Presto, no more lead armor, and the Kryptonite worked! Superman had to fly away fast, that time. I think Supergirl helped him trick the bad guys that time. Anyhow, thanks for all the memories! 20 MAY 08, 1717 hrs, GMT.", 9876, "AA10159262", -1],

	104255 : ["Not all babies are born with blue eyes, whoever said that is stupid. My daughter was born with brown eyes and she still has brown eyes. Some babies are born with blue eyes because there eyes are not fully developed. Sometimes it is hard to tell what color a babies eyes will be, because babies eyes are not open very often and their melanin is not darkened yet. For the most part all babies are born with the color of eyes they will end up with, maybe just lighter. And yes the guy talking about alleles was correct, two people with brown eyes can have a baby with blue, green, or hazel eyes. There are also other factors that determine eye color and shade. Both of my parents have brown eyes and i have gray eyes. It is also possible(but very rare) for two parents with blue eyes to have a child with brown eyes.", 9879, "None", 0],
	104256 : ["Yes they can. But only if both parents have the recessive gene for blue eyes. Brown eyes are a dominant gene.
