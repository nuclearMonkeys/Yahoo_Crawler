The producers foist their manipulations and contrivances on the cast and let it all play out, so their reactions are real and feel real rather than acted out, but that too is part of not entirely true to reality since the cast members have all been personality tested, vetted, and cast specifically for their penchant for unusual dramatics and histrionics and put with other such people whose personalities they will clash with.  Essentially, a structured-reality show is like putting a bunch of volatile chemicals into a dumpster (the cast), tossing in a Molotov cocktail (the made-up situations by the producers), and then filming whatever happens, but if all goes according to the producers' plan, it will be a very real and massive litany of explosions, flames, and towering inferno that will be very entertaining for viewers at home to watch.", 3532, "None", 1],

I absolutely loathe and detest the hyena. Cowards that can only attack if there is a group (cackle) of them.
