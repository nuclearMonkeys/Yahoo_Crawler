	91500 : ["There are still some who care, but they are much harder to find. There have been all sorts of changes in the worldwide society in the past few decades.  Unfortunately, I think that generally people are more self centered and selfish in their outlook as a whole This combined with the \"throw away relationship\" mentality means people are not as caring and gracious to others anymore. Decades ago, I gave a poster to someone I love which was kind of ugly actually - off-white with a big red dot.  But the words on the poster were meaningful.  I don't know who the author was, but the last phrase was \"Part of me will always be you, and part of you will always be me.  That much is certain, no matter what else happens.\" That is so true.  It hurts though when the part of me that is \"you' is so much bigger and important than the part of \"you\" that is me.  This person basically told me that I never meant anything to him.  As you can imagine, it feels like a large part of me has been amputated as a result. He is not the only one who has done such a thing.  Friendship after friendship has been revealed as essentially one-sided, and more of me is amputated with each discovery.  Sadly, I think our society is going further and further in this direction.

	91512 : ["Does it explain the current cold winter?  It may do, it may not, there isn't enough data yet to say with any degree of certainty. The article is describing conditions known as an Arctic Dipole Anomaly or Arctic Oscillation (AO).  Ordinarily the Arctic weather is governed by anticyclonic conditions (high pressure) over Siberia and this feeds air into the cyclonic (low pressure) system that dominates northern Canada.  This circumpolar flow of air establishes predictable patterns over the Arctic with winds, ice-floes and ocean currents rotating in a clockwise direction. During times of an AO the pattern is reversed.  First the winds begin to rotate anticlockwise, these push ice away from the shorelines and into open water and then the Transpolar Drift Current (TD) begins to flow in the opposite direction.  In turn this reverses the flow of the Barents and Beaufort Gyres.  Think of them like three cogs in a row where the TD is in the middle, the direction the TD flows in determines the rotation of the gyres. Up until 50 years ago there was a steady 10 to 11 million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic each summer but in recent years it has receded to about 6 million kmยฒ thus exposing large areas of water that would otherwise be covered by the ice.   New ice reflects about 80% of incoming energy from the Sun, the dirty multiyear ice reflects about 50% but the ocean waters only reflect about 15%.  Therefore there is a significant increase in the amount of heat energy being absorbed into the waters of the Arctic region.  This creates something of a catch 22 situation in that the extra heat melts more ice which then allows more heat to be absorbed and so on. To apply the numbers:  Historically 13.5 million kmยฒ ice annual average, today it's 11 million, therefore reflectance of 2.5 million kmยฒ has decreased from approx 65% to 15%.  At an average of 342 Watts per square metre per year incoming solar radiation, the increased absorption is equivalent to 171 W/mยฒ/yr over 2.5 trillion mยฒ, a total of 427.5 terawatts.  This compares to Earth's energy budget of 174 petawatts or an increase of approx 0.25%, enough in itself to cause some 0.085ยฐC of warming on a global scale. Whilst this oscillation is a new weather phenomenon, one that first manifested itself in 2001, it didn't come as a surprise as such an event had long been predicted as a consequence of global warming.  There have been four such episodes so far and the most pronounced and disruptive has been this years. Early this year we had similar conditions, this kept Arctic ice-extent at very low levels, we began the year at a record low for 1st Jan.  As the oscillation reversed there was a rapid build up of ice, such that by the end of April the ice-extent was at it's greatest for that time of year for several years.  Then the ice began melting at an extraordinary rate, so much so that in the space of just one month it had gone from a recent high to an all time low. The rapid melting continued until 29th June when the Arctic weather patterns went into reverse, the rate of melt slowed significantly and as the weather oscillated back and forth there were periods of rapid melting followed by periods of stability, something that's never been known to happen before.  (note: graphic was created on 19th Sept 2010). The Arctic is still misbehaving and despite the fact that it's winter, the sea-ice extent is less today than it was a week ago, something that never happens at this time of year.  This next graphic is right up to date:   What does it all mean?  It means that the Arctic has gone haywire, there's ice receding in winter, the ocean currents are moving in the opposite direction to what they should be, ice levels are at record lows and the temperature at the most northerly permanent settlement in the world (Alert on Ellesmere Island) is warmer than it is in Edinburgh.  Currently minus 2ยฐC in Alert and minus 6ยฐC in Edinburgh, normally at this time of year it's about minus 30ยฐC in Alert and plus 4 in Edinburgh    ", 9401, "AA10993476", 8],

	91514 : ["If you check out the jet stream you'll observe that if your particular piece of real estate is north of the jet stream you'll have 'cold' weather.  Here in Arizona, southern California and most of the US southwest we're south of the jet stream.  Because of that our weather is unusually warm for December.  What does this mean?  Because of  gradual climatic changes, the result of an historically and geologically more robust 'greenhouse effect',  the jet stream is beginning to dip down further south while the top of this wave has moved further north. This is a new thing in the world of climate...at least in an historical time frame.  As this wave meanders across the planet the effect is either unseasonal cold or warmth depending which side of this river of moving atmosphere you're on.  This of course is only the Cliff Notes version; there's a whale of a lot of higher math involved as to why the jet stream has become so erratic.  What is known is that the less heat energy radiated into space in a 24 hour period requires atmospheric changes to balance the heat and energy equation....the jet stream's apparent greater amplitude is a part of balancing act.   Adding increasing amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere makes this balancing act increasingly more erratic and more difficult to track and/or predict.   This is a situation with a lot of moving parts, all of them tending to create problems or opportunities depending on where you live on Planet Earth.  To say 'it isn't happening' when ALL of the data and the science reflects the opposite is a form of foolishness that borders on the creepy.
