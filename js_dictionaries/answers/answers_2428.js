	127239 : ["Lots of cities and peoples mentioned in scripture were doubted for centuries until archaeologists finally found solid evidence... which supported the Biblical narrative. For instance, the Hittites were thought for centuries to be a fictional tribe invented by Biblical authors. However, in the late 19th century, irrefutable evidence was found which confirmed their existence. The span of time from their first mention in scripture until scientists found remains of their civilization was ABOUT 35 CENTURIES.  Have you noticed that the same is true of many elementary biology texts, that they CONFUSE ASSUMPTION AND THEORY WITH \"VERIFIABLE FACTS\"? What FACTS are behind Darwinistic theory and macro-evolution?  What about the FACT that NO POSITIVE INHERITED MUTATION creating a new species better adapted than its ancestors HAS EVER BEEN OBSERVED.  Evolution by natural selection would require BILLIONS of this type of mutation to be true, and science has NEVER OBSERVED EVEN ONE. Our educators have trouble facing the FACT that science is pretty good at describing WHAT IS, but rather weak on PROVING HOW IT GOT THAT WAY.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH LEAVING \"ORIGINS\" WHERE THEY BELONG, WITH OTHER THEORIES, INSTEAD OF BLINDLY ACCEPTING A WEAK THEORY ON PHILOSOPHICAL RATHER THAN SCIENTIFIC GROUNDS TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL ELSE. If evolution had been treated FAIRLY for the last half century, WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER, MORE SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND THEORY NOW. As it is, any scientist who attempts to come up with a bio-genesis theory with fewer holes is immediately met with fierce opposition... on PHILOSOPHICAL, NOT SCIENTIFIC GROUNDS.

The right facing swastika is a Hindu symbol that means evolution, while the left facing swastika is the symbol for Buddhism, and is still found on Buddhist temples everywhere. It means eternity. It also means God is everything, the universe. The other way to look at that is the Satanical viewpoint I am God, the reason Jesus was killed. Hitler funded Bayer pharmaceuticals which invented many drugs like methadone, oxycodone, demerol, and tons of methamphetamine, pharmaceutical name Pervitin that was prescribed by the boat load to German and Japanese soldiers. Even the allies were given it once they realized it worked to improve efficiency. They were cooking up speed on the battlefield, a German soldier wrote a letter to his mother where the main thing he talked about was could you get them to send us more Pervitin. This isn't widely known, nor is the long history of heroin and opiates generally. You think the wars in the countries in the Golden triangle were about communism? Yeah right.

They have bought a false assumption about the Bible -- This false assumption is that the Bible is literally true, without error. Now there's no basis for this, so we need evidence to show why one should believe this. Of course, there's no evidence, because the premise is utter bunk to begin with, but there is a large group of folks who don't really have the capacity to follow a logical argument to begin with, and they have no intention of doing so when they already \"Know\" what they know, and if they ever gave it up, they would have to totally rebuild their belief system. I know. It's sad that people would rather live a lie, driven by false belief in a terrorist, sadistic god, than to repent, turn from their evil ways, learn the truth, and be healed. (Sorry, Isaiah) But that's the way it is. Since they've now joined in battle, they paint with a broad brush: evolution is an attack on their god (it's not). Science is a vast conspiracy of godless pagans who want to stifle the truth about the true god. So all of science is lying about all this evolution stuff. That's right: all of science is perfectly aware that all the stuff they're producing about evolution is just lies. There is some unfortunate collateral damage from this warfare: They figure that since scientists are lying like hell about evolution, they are also lying like hell about environmental problems, and whenever anyone says anything positive about taking good care of the planet, they instantly interpret it as a sign that this person is also in on the conspiracy. And that is one big reason why very little of scientific benefit gets done in the United States anymore. They won't say it outright (becaus everybody would think they were crazy) but they do not trust science at all. So there you have it.
