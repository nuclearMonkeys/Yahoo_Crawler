The real issues are the food chains.  Growing the food is a snap, but processing and delivering it to the consumers are more problematic.  Politics often bans food from being distributed.  Broken or non-existing roads and rails make moving food to the users a major issue.  And large scale poverty makes food unaffordable in many nations. My point.  The supply of food is not the issue.  The distribution of the food to users is the issue.", 3688, "74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa", -2],

It is only in our century that the oceans are dying for all the plastics humans have thrown out and the pollution that causes climate change.

They should be sued through a class action lawsuit.
