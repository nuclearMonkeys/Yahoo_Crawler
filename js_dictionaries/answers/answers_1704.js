First u ask him to get a job. Discuss with ur parents, and let him handle the house for one week. Let him pay the bills, fix things and manage the whole house with no support from u or ur parents. He will then know what a job it is. And u do know that all kind of sexual relationships, before marriage(even if it is with ur fiance) are *****. Why didn't u tell him that, when u saw ur brother make out. It's ur responsibility, Allah won't question u for ur brother's deeds but, as ur his elder sis it's ur duty to inform him of what is and what is not allowed in Islam. U should tell him at least, we muslims have obligations to tell about our religion to other non muslims, if it so, then what about ur own brother? Surely Allah will ask u about it, Insha Allah. Don't get too involved if u don't want to, but at least have a talk with him about this. Allah(swt) will definitely guide u both, Insha Allah, salaam.. :)", 9372, "cPDX4VgVaa", 1],

Believe it or now 15 is not to young for marriage that is just a modern day standard,in the old days 15 was not just married but also taking care of his family and siblings.

	90869 : ["I agree entirely with Sakura! His young and in love. He's blind! He needs a taste of what responsibility is before he can just say I WANA GET MARRIED... Honestly, if that was my 15 year old MUSLIM brother making out with a MUSLIM girl in PUBLIC - I'd slap him! What kind of portrayal of Islam is he giving??? Bad bad bad example of Muslims. We're supposed to be pure and chaste, and GUARD ourselves! Al-Quran \"And come not near to Zina. Verily, it is a faahishah (a great sin) and an evil opening leading to other evils.\" (Sura Al-Israa # 17 ayah # 32) >> Allah doesn't say DO NOT COMMIT ZINA - He say's DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO IT!!! I'm not judging you sister, but the Islamic morals in your family are quite LOW... It's great that you oppose your brother's actions though. He needs to understand the depth of his sin. Boys mature later than girls. However girls are attention seekers. NEITHER OF THEM KNOW WHAT LOVE IS, NOR DO THEY ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY MARRIAGE IS. If they were 17 and 18, I'd say it's fine. But when you're young, you're stupid. Islam is a way of life, a shield and a guard. ((That is why women are supposed to wear Hijab, becoz while you are in that Islamic dress, you ARE MODEST! It stops you from committing such acts... Eg, Teens kissing in public...)) My advise to you: Get yourself well equipped with your religion. ISLAM is your way of life, not just a Muslim name and \"La'ila ha illallaa\". Once you understand your brothers sin, make him understand. And of course Allah will call you up on the day of Qiyama and ask \"When your brother was committing a sin in front of you - what did you do to stop him?\" Also remember that the Prophet was reported to have said: ((Hadith)) \"If you see an evil, remove it with your hand,* If you cannot then speak out against it...\" if you cannot then feel bad about it in your heart and that is the weakest form of iman.\" I hope you take heed to my words sister.

All sounds straightforward doesn't it?  Now, here comes the tricky bit.  As your g/f is a student, she must have proof that she has held comprehensive health insurance covering her time studying in the UK to be recognised as exercising her treaty rights.  Most students don't bother with this because they have access to the free NHS so this is where you may come unstuck. If so, you can subject yourself to Finnish immigration law and apply for a spouse visa to live with her in Finland. Other than that your g/f must finish her studies, get a job and marry you.  All before your visa expires. Romance versus visa.  Visa versus romance. How long do you think you will be married before the inevitable accusation is voiced about why you married her if you choose this route? If you are a student, what's wrong with you getting a good enough degree to be competitive in the UK market and be able to convert to a post study work visa and then a a Tier 2 work visa on your own merits?

No adult male should spank a 15 year old female's bare bottom.  But at the same time, he should not have been watching when his female designate spanked your bare bottom. I hope he turned away.  As for the spanking, I think you richly deserved it.  Go back and look at my first paragraph and see all the things that you did wrong.  I hope your brother reinforces your punishment with at least two months of grounding and no privileges at all (no cell phone, no land line, no television, no computer (including no internet browsing and emails), no ipod, etc.). And by the way, if you complain to the authorities about the spanking, your brother can turn you and your friends in for underage drinking, a far more serious offense (there are ways of proving this after the fact).  That should make you very popular with your friends!  In the end, you broke the law with alcohol and they \"may\" have broken the law with the brush (not the spanking).
