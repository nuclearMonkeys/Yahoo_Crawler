	855 : ["Hybrids are crosses between species, not subspecies. Most are infertile but some are fertile. There is a group of minnows that is not only perfectly fertile between species but between genera. Subspecies are geographically demarcated groups within a species. Where two subspecies' ranges abut, they interbreed and the offspring are called intergrades. If you discount the intergrades, you can usually ID the correct subspecies between 80% and 100% of the time. This is not a hard and fast rule, though. You can also have a kline, in which there is variation within a species that changes gradually along a line. For example, shell shape changes in snapping turtles from north to south. It is not until you get to peninsular Florida (which was formerly cut off as an island) that you get a distinct subspecies.", 154, "DVdX6I4kaa", 0],

If light is completely absent then nothing can see and neither would T. rex have been able to. It may have had adaptations like many extant species which meant is could see reasonably well in low light levels. Remember in the wild there is never 100% absence of light; there is always some ambient light. In areas where it is totally dark organisms in those areas either never had sight or have evolved from ancestors that had sight but as it is of no use its loss has evolved.", 158, "kz04oBhsaa", 0],

Even animals today with phenomenal eye sight can't see in pitch black, animals like bats depend on echo location.Â  Â Â  Trex were not very fast but they had phenomenal stamina, phenomenal eye sight and possibly an unmatched sense of smell [along with a few other supertheropods]. While they couldn't see in pitch black, they almost certainly could see pretty clearly at night thanks to starlight and the moon [just like some big cats today].Â  Â  This points to them being nocturnal hunters like many of todays apex predators.Â  Â  Animals like triceratops, just like rhinos today, likely had poor vision and depended more on smell and sound.Â ", 158, "xHsQFPsBaa", 1],

	871 : ["Being afraid of the dark often starts in childhood and is viewed as a normal part of development.

It is natural to fear the unknown.Â  That is why many adults are scared of the covid vaccine.Â  They do not know how it is made and some of them think they may get the virus infection if they take the vaccine. Sometimes children endanger themselves because they have no idea what is or is not dangerous. Lack of knowledge is the reason why we sometimes fear something we should not, and also why we often do something that is dangerous to us, such as not wearing a face mask or social distance during the pandemic. IOW, fear of the dark, fear of vaccines, and not wearing face masks are all caused by lack of knowledge.Â ", 143, "None", 0],

In the UK most of us would be horrified by the thought of eating horse but horsemeat is widely eaten in many other parts of Europe. I think most Europeans would be sickened by the idea of eating dog but it is widely eaten in Eastern Asia. There is no objective reason for this. Many of us will consume beef, lamb or pork and when we do we are consuming the skeletal muscle of cows, sheep and pigs. Why should eating the skeletal muscles of horses or dogs be different? They are all mammals. A lot of it is down to culture, personal taste and squeamishness.

	892 : ["Where did she get that idea? I can tell you that it doesn't feel much different to a woman whether a condom is used or not. There are very few nerve endings in the vagina, and the stimulation a women gets is not inside the vagina, but from pressure on the clitoris.

It's nice to see a man that's responsible about using protection. From my experience, most guys only use them if the woman insists on it. Then they get upset when she ends up pregnant. You're definitely smart for taking responsibility for yourself. But you should have this discussion with HER. There may be a reason why she wants to stop using condoms.
