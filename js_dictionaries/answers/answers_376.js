So, churches who closed for COVID (or had COVID measures like dipping spoon into some liquid like alcohol) are no longer Christ's but now are working for Satan promoting the new COVID religion. Last Patriarch is Patriarch Irenaios 1st. He blessed Catacomb movement. For liturgy what you need is antiminis (towel with remains of saints sewn into it); wax candles; one cup/one spoon; non-Kosher non-yeast non-barcoded non-qrcoded wine/bread. Kosher = sprinkled with blood. Yeast is grown on pig bacteria. QRcode = barcode = mark of the beast. Roman Catholics tried one cup and one spoon and got sick with Bubonic plague (no laughing matter). You must hide (within a small group of 10-15 people according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov) in order to escape the unforgivable mark of the beast. No documents once you hid because documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. No electronics once you hid because antichrist's minions will track you using electronics that you got. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the antichrist using Tesla's ether. In case you're in 'Murica and want to hide, then consider inland Alaska. Arctic Circle = Security Circle for WW3.

	20394 : ["MS is a \"right to work\" or \"at will\" state. You should know this by living there. But for those who don't, it means you can be terminated for no reason at all, as long as you aren't fired for being in a protected class under the constitution. But, you can qualify for unemployment if your reason for leaving is for good cause. In this case, you left for being fired when you called in because you thought your health and safety was being compromised. This is a slam dunk win for you, because your separation was not due to malice or a reason attributed to you. Since you worked at Subway, with your state unemployment and current federal subsidies as of late and near future, you will probably make more by not working. Business pay state (SUTA) and federal (FUTA) unemployment insurance tax as a percentage of wages. These percentages go up for businesses who have a history of higher unemployment claims that are approved. By Subway firing you and because your claim will be approved, their unemployment tax will go up, so they are hurting themselves in the long run. You may be denied initially, although I doubt that, but you would win on appeal. If you aren't approved first, you must appeal the decision, and then you will prevail because you will be on a three-way call with the state unemployment adjudicator and a representative of Subway. As a former unemployment adjudicator, your case is solid. Many law makers hate your situation because with the extension of federal unemployment funds included currently and those in president Biden's Covid Bill, you can collect from your state and from the federal program. Previously, the federal program (FUTA) only paid if the state program (SUTA) ran out of money, and then it would only pay what the state was paying. However now, they are both paying out benefits at the same time which is the only time in history that this has occurred. To be denied unemployment benefits, you must have been terminated for good cause and that being something you did that was a breach of company policy, knowingly or purposely creating malice or ill intent, or something that a reasonable person would find negligent. Your case isn't like that. If I received your case, I would ask Subway why they fired you. Let's assume they would say for not coming to work. Then I would ask you why you didn't go to work. If you said, \"I explained to my supervisor that I could not come to work because the roads were hazardous because of ice and I was afraid that I may have been involved in an accident\" . I would then ask Subway, \"Were you aware that roads in your area may have had icy conditions\"? I wouldn't care what Subway had to say, but I would listen. They might say, \"Well maybe yes in some places, but other employees got to work\". I might then ask both of you, \"Do you know what the temperature was at the time\"? As an adjudicator, I would already know that because I would have investigated this prior to the call. Sincerity and honesty plays a part in the adjudication process, as well as mannerisms. I am not saying I expect the employer or the employee to be dishonest, but I would rely on facts and the candor of each party. It's not a court of law. It's about who seems more credible and in this case, your side of the story is more credible than that of Subway.", 3331, "uNXD3JOgaa", 1],
