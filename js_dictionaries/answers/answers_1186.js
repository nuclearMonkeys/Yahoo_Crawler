	64793 : ["Wow the others people must be easily amused.  This ride is WORST ROLLERCOASTER i have ever ridden in my life. The atmosphere of the ride is above par compared to the average coaster. The ride itself though is a 5 out of 10 at best(I would give it a 3). Its comparable to the \"Ragin Cajun\" rollercoaster in the Mardi Gras section. If you want to see what dark knight looks like in the light view Ragin Cajun. If you think you would like Ragin Cajun then you might like the dark knight(i purposely didnt captalize it b/c its that bad). I would say avoid this ride at all costs. There is plenty of other good rides at six flags that are 10 times better.", 8275, "ZNnq01KEaa", 1],
	64794 : ["I thought it was the worst ride I have ever been on in my life. The line outside was at least a 2 1/2 hour wait. I had the flash pass so I got in within 5 minutes of waiting... If I would have waited for 2 hours to ride it, I would have been so mad.  I didnt even want to go again with the flash pass thats how bad it was. It was nothing special, just fast turns. You couldnt see much because it is inside and supposed to be set in a subway so it's dark with the walls covered in neon paint in places. It was also over very quickly. Me and the people I went with were just in shock at how horrible it was. (It was the 1st ride we went on)  A cool concept, but too short, unthrilling, and not worth the wait. If you get a flash pass you might check it out just to see for yourself, but if you dont, I wouldnt bother waiting in line.", 8275, "RbKZoDUNaa", 1],

I remember ging to Seaside Heights on the boardwalk over the ocean...and then a few years later...going there again..and it was all gone...I was devastated...I had so much fun the last time. But anyway....go to Great America and have a ball. One admission (where I live), and you get to see anything and everything.  All is free (because the price includes it).  The only things you have to pay for is:  food, drink, souveniours. But you didn't expect to get that for free, did you? There are shows, make sure that you check the times for all of them, arrange your time to see them all.  First come first get in.  If you are too late, the seats will be taken and you will have to wait for the next show.  I loved the shows. The rides are alot of fun.  They are strict about the height rules. Just go, and have a ball! . .", 8275, "hskHZ36jaa", 17],
	64804 : ["I am a season pass holder and here are some tips.  You should expect lines. Since it's pretty cold and Wednesday the lines might be pretty short so you are lucky. The prices for food is kind off high and water bottles cost 3 dollars. They don't let you on the rides with a backpack so you are going to have to pay for a locker. Instead what you should do is bring a fanny pack, they will let you on the rides with that. You should bring 1. Water bottle 2. Money 3. Cell phone 4. And sunscreen There are a few water rides so if you want to get wet, you can. Some of the rides are pretty scary. Here are some rides I recommend 1. Kingda Ka: It's the fastest and tallest in the world. The line for this can get really long even on Wednesday. Go on this one first. It might seem scary but by midday the lines are long and Kingda Ka has a tendency to break down (not kidding).  2. Nitro: Great roller coaster. Super fast 3. Medusa: A lot of loops 4. Superman: feels like you are flying. 5. El Toro: Really scared me", 8275, "None", 0],

The worst is the Rattler cuz its a wooden coaster and ur neck snaps back and forth totally unsecured so its easy to get a sore neck the nxt day which is no fun.  Well enjoy ur day there its loads of fun despite ur feelings towards them as long as u have a freind with ya u will do just about any ride.  :( now i wanna go but i live 216miles south of Six Flags  grrrr", 8275, "MQ2GL5jhaa", 0],
	64809 : ["King Da Ka- it's a world record rollercoaster, fastest and the tallest, there tends to be a wicked long line, but worth it. there is also a new wooden coaster called el torro i believe, i have not been on it since it opened but i have heard good things about it.

	64812 : ["Gosh....I really want the Celtics to win only because Lakers & San Antonio Spurs have dominated the NBA the last 10 years which is really annoying. But Lakers are just too big for the Celtics and the bench is far more talented then the Celtics. I'm glad the Celtics got this far. The Celtics need an answer for Paul Gasol and Lamar Odom. Kobe will be Kobe so let him score at will. You really need a starting 6 not a starting 5 cause it takes like 2 starters to beat Kobe. The other problem is the Laker's bench. They are fast and great offensively. If Celtics lose, they will need to add a couple of big men, a point guard if Lakers double team Paul Pierce from scoring. Celtics will really need Rolando and Ray Allen to play big and they are not consistent so far. I see Lakers taking a road game and being undefeated at home. This will probably mirror what we see with the Utah Jazz series except Lakers winning. It will be a close series but Kobe is just too perfect and will suck the energy out of the Celtics defense.", 8276, "Ik9S8e5Paa", 0],

	64814 : ["i might think of Lakers might win the finals. I have not any situation with the two team. i like Kobe, he's robust. Gasol is spectacular, and Odom can quite placed on a teach. Boston has spectacular gamers too. Garnett is a beast. Ray Allen has the main appealing jumpshot ever. Pierce and Rondo are cool too. I quite think of that Lakers are greater known to win. take a glance on the bench. Lakers have a much greater constructive bence. The Celtics bench is a \"roleplayer\" bench. Lakers bench has more desirable critically and each and each participant can pitch in around 10-20 factors on a powerful day. in basic terms such as you mentioned, Lakers actual have a coaching benefit, with ol' Phil being interior the finals for the eleventh time. this is Rivers' first time. Lakers offense is likewise severe. on a similar time as you are able to argue that the Boston's great 3 is risky (which they're--Garnett is frightening whilst he dunks, Allen can shoot, and Pierce can sink threes in spite of a sprained knee). besides the fact that, they're inconsistant. the three will kick butt one night, yet thoroughly fail yet yet lower back. to boot, no longer all the great 3 carry out with one yet another. whilst Pierce is getting sturdy seems, Allen is in a shooting hunch. now and lower back, whilst Garnett is having a mvp-variety interest, Pierce is lacking layups. they're inconsistant. Rondo is like that too. whilst he's robust, no longer something can quit him. whilst he's no longer, there is no longer even a would desire to guard him. Fisher and Bryant are secure as ever. they might oftentimes combine for maybe 30+ factors, and get a powerful volume of assists, too. Gasol and Odom are tall, quickly and unsafe. inspite of the certainty that Lakers have greater constructive offense, Boston kills on protection. They saved Kobe to around 24 factors according to interest on like 33 % of shooting this season. Boston additionally dominates the rebounds. that would desire to be a situation for the Lakers. inspite of this, I anticipate the Lakers to leap lower back in interest 2. interest a million wasn't an entire catastrophe, the two. The Lakers even lead up till the third quarter. i think of that they are going to regain their composure, and finally strengthen yet another banner of their Stales center area.", 8276, "oGCUE6SRaa", 0],

	64836 : ["Now that the Pistons have Allen Iverson on their team, they stand a fairly good chance of going to the playoffs and possibly making the Finals. After Chauncey was traded to Denver for AI, I was left scratching my head and wondering about the trade. Why trade a PG who was basically one of the team captains and the person who got you to the Eastern Conference Finals for six consecutive years? And he got you to the Finals (and was a big reason you won) and won MVP in the process. Chauncey has won in the Finals, while AI has not. Now that I think about it, it's good for AI to come to a \"team\" like Detroit just to see how he can blend in with this core group of guys. So far, he's doing fine. When he was drafted No. 1 by the Philadelphia 76ers, that team had no identity and no face to be recognized with and he changed all that. The only downside is that he was forced to do EVERYTHING! He was the face of the franchise for 10 years and they did him greasy. Then, he was traded to Denver and that team was different because he had some people on that team who could do the scoring and not leave him with the load. Now, he comes to a team that is well-established and even though he may have an off-night, he's got FOUR or FIVE others to pick up the load for him!", 8276, "d754b3be3baefac8167410c09de8770faa", 1],
