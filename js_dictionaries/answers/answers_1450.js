I don't care what people are thinking. Some people want to rule the world and cause problems. I already have things figured out.

People not familiar with \"Civil Rights\" and \"Jim Crow\" require explanations for the \"It is not about race\" statement.

I believe Jillian is my favorite, and Lorelai is a close second. As for boys names, I love Liam Gabriel and Zachary Cole. I hate, sorry, Blaine Asher (it doesn't flow with the style of your other names, plus I just think it sounds tacky). Brody Matthew is alright, but I like Liam and Zachary much better... and I know people who have dogs named Brody... just saying. Ezekiel isn't bad.. .but I just think it is too biblical. I love Eli or Elijah though. I really like the name Stella.. it is an older name that is making a huge comeback. Margaret is a nice name, but I'm not super fond of it as a first name. What about Stella Margaret as a first/middle name combo?", 8931, "bFP27tDMaa", 0],

	78197 : ["The party that he was part of would choose a new candidate, most probably the number 2 guy, or woman, in the primaries.  They could, however choose whoever they wanted.  Political parties pretty much govern themselves.  They aren't covered in the Constitution.  They developed originally to organize politicians with similar views of policies. Primary elections aren't covered in the Constitution either.  Large parties use them to gauge the public's opinion of possible candidates and usually go with the one who wins according to how their system is set up.  This isn't always the case.  In 1976, Ronald Reagan beat Gerald Ford narrowly, according to the vote, but the Republican Party felt like it had a better chance of winning with the incumbent, so they gave the nomination to Gerald Ford and lost the election.  The smaller parties don't hold primaries.  Their governing body just chooses one to run in the general election with no real hopes of winning or even being close to the DNC or GOP. So I guess the actual answer is no one really knows.  It depends on what party officials want at that moment in time.  Smaller parties would just pick another candidate the same way they picked the first, since they don't hold primaries.  Congress has the option of voting to give the ill-fated party more time prepare by postponing the election.  This would never happen out of fairness, only if the affected party is in control. To Golden:  That is what happens after they are elected, not before the election.", 8936, "AJZz7GnRaa", 1],
