For instance, the word ***** didn't become a curse word until it was used more to describe people, suggesting that their behavior was like that of a female dog.  Because this is seen and often used as an insult to one's person, it's considered a bad word rather than a harmless metaphor.

So, the disease does not really show up this case... unless both X's have are defected. However, the male has only one X.

	63247 : ["Color blindness, or color vision deficiency, in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some or all colors that other people can distinguish. It is most often of genetic nature, but may also occur because of eye, nerve, or brain damage, or due to exposure to certain chemicals. The English chemist John Dalton in 1794 published the first scientific paper on the subject, \"Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours\",  after the realization of his own color blindness; because of Dalton's work, the condition is sometimes called Daltonism, although this term is now used for a type of color blindness called deuteranopia. Color blindness is usually classed as a disability; however, in select situations color blind people have advantages over people with normal color vision. Color blind hunters are better at picking out prey against a confusing background, and the military have found that color blind soldiers can sometimes see through camouflage that fools everyone else. Monochromats may have a minor advantage in dark vision, but only in the first five minutes of dark adaptation.", 8199, "82011c3e3e73fb39700f19355bb2ef5caa", -1],

But the cell that did not get divided (the chromosome in it which did not get divided, in other words) still lives.
