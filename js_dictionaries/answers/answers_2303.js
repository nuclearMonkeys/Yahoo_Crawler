	120954 : ["You don't say how old the kitten is. Normally, a kitten needs to stay with her litter and mother for 12 weeks or so. This enables the kitten to be properly socialized. Kittens learn not to bite and scratch from their litter mates and mother. A bite during play earns the kitten a nip or swat. A kitten that is taken from the mother too early does not get that training. If the kitten is still young, you may be able to break her of the bad habit. You need to immediately stop her if she bites your hand (even playfully) and give a stern \"No!\" Wait a few moments and attempt to play again. Repeat as necessary. The idea is to teach her that biting a person is never acceptable. Cats differ in their acceptance of human affection. Most cats are more accepting of \"head pets\" than petting of their back. Try to start petting only her head with gentle scratches behind the ears. Also, sit on the floor with the kitten in a quiet environment and let her come to you. Her natural curiosity will eventually have her coming onto your lap. When she does this a few times and feels comfortable, gently stroke her head. You need to socialize the kitten before letting her alone with the children for all of their sakes.  Good luck with the new kitten.", 10633, "6768c11da3a7523681b339d4d16ff8b6aa", 0],

	120974 : ["Apply sunscreen. Sometimes cold sores can be caused by sun exposure, so applying sunscreen that is SPF 15 or more can help prevent new scabs from forming near the already scabbed cold sores. See a doctor. Make sure that you are actually getting cold sores and not something else, such as canker sores. If you get oral sores often, see a doctor to make sure you are treating them correctly. Avoid eating salty and acidic foods. These foods can irritate a cold sore scab. It will take longer for it to heal. Cover the cold sore. Petroleum-based products (such as Vaseline) can help cover up a cold sore, keeping it from drying out and allowing it to heal. Use pain killers. Topical anesthetics, which use benzocaine, will help numb the affected area. Standard painkillers like aspirin and ibuprofen will also help. This will help keep you from touching the sore to often, irritating it and preventing the scab from healing.", 10638, "2trNTbC3aa", -2],

For an at home treatment, dab on a bit of vitamin E oil or olive oil to your lips after a shower, let it sink in for a few minutes and then seal it with a coat of vaseline. Make sure you are also drinking enough water because cracked lips can be a sign that you need water. Do this at least once a day and your lips should feel better in about a week maximum. If not, then you should go see a doc and see what he/she suggests. Best of luck! ;)", 10638, "MB9AcAWSaa", -1],
	120977 : ["It sounds like she didn't get much attention or affection at her previous home. She isn't used to a lot of human contact and doesn't know how to react. The biting, scratching, and climbing are somewhat normal for young kittens. She will likely be a little wild until at least two years of age. Kittens and young cats have A LOT of energy! Since she is still young, her behavior can be \"changed\". I suggest giving her as much attention as she will allow. She might not enjoy being picked up and held - which can be normal for some cats. It's just her personality. Get down to her level on the floor, pet her, and talk sweetly. If she shows aggression or irritation, leave her alone for a while and try again later. If you ignore her or attempt to \"discipline\" her behavior, she will only get worse. As far as the biting and scratching - do not allow her to use your hands or body for that. Use a small stuffed toy while playing with her so that she learns it's okay to \"attack\" the toy. If she goes for your hands or body, pull away and ignore her. You will really have to keep up with this in order to teach her that hands/bodies are not toys. This sounds like a lot of work and it probably will be for a while. If you are worried about the safety of your children, it might be a good idea to find this kitten another home. You did a great thing by taking her in though!", 10633, "QnQsPowKaa", 1],

	120988 : ["Okay first of all when the champions league (european cup) first started out years ago it only included champions from each country within the european continent, they all faced off in a knockout competiton. However the european cup now named 'The UEFA champions league' involves not only champions but runners up, 3rd place and 4th places from countries around europe. Some countries have 4 of their teams represent them while some other countries a measly one if not any at all. Down the time they decided that just having the champions play eachother wasnt enough entertainment and wouldnt allow the competition to live to its potential.. simply because a team from a country small enough to be a town could be rounded up with a big team like Barcelona and they'd get smashed 10-0. So now the competition is better at filtering teams out into more accurate match ups so teams are not humiliated and the football is more fun to watch. England, Spain, Italy As far i know have the best teams in europe right now over the last 4 yrs and so each enter 4 teams. This season Sain have Barcelona, R.Madrid, Villareal and Valencia representing them. Some champions (plus others) of countries dont get entered at the group stage automatically and must face qualifiers before getting into the competition. The group stage is where the competition officially starts.. each group consists of 4 teams that must play eachother in their respective group.. there are 8 groups in total. the two teams ending with highest points go through to the knockout stage. The bottom teams gets nothing. However the third place team gets a bypass into the Europa League which is a step below the champions league. The europa league is for teams 5th-8th place usually but you main find some teams fall from the champions league into this competition. This sort of makes up for a teams hard effort in the previous season. The knockout stages are of course straight forward.. get beaten your out of the competition.. win and your through to the next round.. you play each team twice in the group stage but must aim to get the most points. In the knockout stage you play a team over a two legged round. Team with better goal ratio or more away goals goes through. Yeah it sounds complicated but the more you watch it you will understand it :)", 10630, "m0Zoxssaaa", 1],
