	122558 : ["The thing to understand is that an object with height h at rest has maximum amount of potential energy stored in it. During that time the kinetic energy is zero as there is no velocity. so a)the moment when we release the rock, the velocity is zero hence the kinetic energy should be zero as K=1/2mv^2 where v = 0 b)when an object is set to motion then its potential energy becomes zero as it has no height associated with it. U=mgh where h =0 c)now the moment when the ball hits the ground its velocity is maximum so the kinetic energy is maximum. this velocity is known as its impacy velocity. d)i think this explains the first law of thermodynamics which states that \" Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only be converted from one form to another. The total amount of energy in the universe remains constant.\" So here we convert potential energy to kinetic energy. e)the rock at the top of the building had 100 joules of energy which got converted into kinetic energy in the form of the motion of the rock down to the ground. So the energy didnt vanish. It was infact conserved. i am not completely sure but i think i am close to the answer. I hope this helps.", 10717, "gyrYsMh6aa", 0],
