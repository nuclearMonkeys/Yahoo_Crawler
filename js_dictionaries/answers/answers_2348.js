It would be great for anniversary as well.  No kids.  He had to work.  When he got home, the lights were out.  Candles lit.  I had made big palm trees.  I had a path to the living room.  There I had it staged.  Fire going, the works.  Had chinese food, blanket spread on the floor in front of fire.  But....for your special day.   Make him \"coupons\".  Make 12 of them.  Enough for him to have one each month until the next anniversary.  Use your imagination.  This is cheap, costs nothing!  It comes from the heart.  Let's you use your imagination and let's him receive sexual favors anytime he wishes.  Of course I did put some time into mine and put them on colored paper.  Printed them out.  Made a coupon book.  I will give you examples of what I used and feel free to use them, or like I said, use your imagination and create your own.  Depending on how \"active' the two of you are, you could make 24, 2 a month.   Examples:  Good for 1 oral sex session.                     Good for 1 massage.                   Good for making love anyplace you want. Your pick                   Good for 1 full night of anything you say, goes. You get the idea.  Think of things you know he likes.  I even put one coupon that said good for 1 hand job in a public place.  Your pick.  He absolutely loved it.  And didn't take him long to use them, so they didn't last the entire year.  Along with these, I made a video for him.  Me solo, for him.  Staged in his weight room.  Needless to say, he enjoyed his gifts and they cost me $0.  And they meant more because they came from the heart.  And he had to watch the video first thing, so that started the night out to be hot and sexy!   I know this isn't an idea of what to do.  But it is an idea of a gift, or an extra gift that will be really hot and sexy.  Don't forget to add one in there of 1 night out w/ the guys.  But whatever you decide to do, remember, candles!  You can never go wrong with candles.  And vanilla is an aphrodisiac for men!  A hot bubble bath is a sure thing.  Or a hot bath with silk bath confetti.  A little bit of soft romantic music.  Marvin Gaye is good.  So is Barry White!  Take total control!  Dance/Strip for him.  Whatever you decide I hope you enjoy your anniversary and hope it's the Hottest/Sexist yet!  Let us know what you decide to do if you can.  And how it goes of course.  Oh, and what year?!?!?!   Again, Happy Anniversary!", 10739, "bIimm8fSaa", -1],
	123218 : ["If done wrong it can have massive consequences for the child.  Read the book As Nature Made Him, about a child who had a circumcision based on the doc's recommendation due to a medical condition.  It was later found out that the circumcision was probably not necessary.  They messed it up, and in the end fixed it by giving the baby male to female sex reassignment surgery to be raised as a girl with normal looking female genetalia.  The patient ended up killing himself as young adult as a result of the mental trauma all this had caused him through out his life. \"Personally, it's your body, make your own decisions. \"  Thats the problem, people arent making it for themselves, parents are making the decision for their babies before the person can even have a say in the situation.", 10740, "4R97l14waa", -1],
	123219 : ["There does seem to be some confusion about this and people have blown this way out of proportion. It is more beneficial to be circumcised (reduced risks in STDs, infections, cancer, AIDS, hygiene, etc) BUT there is some argument to how beneficial. And given how you interpret the benefits, is it worth the risk of a circumcision? For example, penile cancer only occurs in uncircumcised men and neonatal circumcision eliminates any risk of cancer occurring. Obviously beneficial but some say say penile cancer is so rare even in uncircumcised men that it's simply not worth the risk.  Some say there are no benefits at all and thus see circumcision as completely unnecessary. However the American Pediatric society sees it differently. In my opinion, as a man who was circumcised in my late teens due to the many issues being uncircumcised can cause... I can tell you that being circumcised is simply better. It is cleaner, it is healthier and frankly feels better sexually. The idea that circumcision effects sexual sensitivity is a myth. Not sure how it could. The only difference in being circumcised is that I don't have to pull back my foreskin anymore. Which is ideal! Why would you not want that?  The foreskin is just a piece of dull excess skin. It might have been nice to have this little hoody if you were running around naked during the ice age, but really? I'm sorry but it is pretty pointless and a weird prehistoric remnant. It just gets gnarly under there all you do is keep pulling it back whenever you use your penis. Ideally you keep it pulled back... hmmmm. What exactly is the point of a foreskin? There is no harm in having it removed and I'm sorry, but it is just not a big deal. I really think people get way too bend out of shape over this. As long as it's done properly there's no reason not to get it done. AND by the way, there's not a single benefit associated with being uncircumcised!", 10740, "None", 0],

	123234 : ["Republicans traditionally have been in favor of less government … Republicans like to spend money for roads, justice, military, and legal issues.   Their motto is to keep government out of Americans lives.  When money is spent on any of these, we the people see our lives get better. (Watch the history channel. . .military marvels).  Republicans want the private corporations to spend corporation money on Democratic issues (social, environmental, and human rights).  Less government allows Republicans to create a Dream, work toward the Dream, and achieve that Dream.  Now, people with passion and people who strive for their dreams and people who aren't watched by the government are happier … and richer. Democrats, on the other hand like to spend money for social issues, environment issues, and human rights issues.  Again these are noble and worthy causes that come back to benefit the American public.  They also need to spend money meeting the basic principals of Republican spending (Road, Justice, Military, and Law).  Thus, Democrats often overspend.  Individually, we see that those who live in Debt are never happy.  I would say that the typical Democrat that I've meet is in debt … They also seem to live day by day not planning for any future goals or dreams;  sadly, I would say they are more promiscuous … not thinking about consequences of their actions.  They have big hearts, but they take care of others before they take care of themselves … they run their lives like the Democratic Party runs the national economy… overspending and burdened by debt.

	123235 : ["Republicans are primarily Conservative republicans. The Conservative mentality itself is about preserving tradition, and essentially limiting the amount and speed of change. To feel this way, one must obviously be happer with the way things currently are than someone who advocates less restrained changes and improvement. Republican conservativism is also connected with Christianity. The conservative republicans likely have the highest amount and concentration of christians. When people put their faith in something higher than themselves, they tend to be (or convince themselves that they are) happier. Another likely contributing factor is that many, if not most conservatives tend have a personality whereby it is easier for them to decide on something, and hold on to it with more will than they even realize. Therefore, it may be easier for republicans to say \"Im happy with my life\" and convince themselves of that reguardless of thier enviroment.", 10742, "None", 0],

Besides it being an obvious disregard of human rights. Death of over 120 newborn infants a year because of the procedure, and who knows how many complications (painful erections, scaring, curving, etc....) It removes the following 1. 15-20k nerve endings. 70-80% of all the nerves the penis has to begin with since most are located in the foreskin and are the most sensitive 2. Gliding action. This allows for the head of the penis to move gently between the foreskin during sex or masturbation, removal of this makes it harder to masturbate (lube) and makes sex more painful for the female partner, which means lube is needed. 3 Ridged band - highly sensitive part of the penis containing meisners corpuscles along with a structure that gives a sensation similar to what a ribbed dildo would do. 4. frenulum - G spot for males. tethering structure similar to the frenulum located between the inside of your upper lip and teeth, this you can touch and get a sense of what this would feel like. 5.

It's not healthy to have this sort of negativity about your body and your sexual organs, you need to have a bit more respect for your body, it's not good to consider your own body to be gross or nasty!  1. Periods are as good or as bad as you make them, they show you're fertile and healthy, there's nothing embarrissing or gross about periods and nothing you cannot do during your period, they are only bad if you make them bad. Women who think positily about periods learn how to manage them so enjoy their periods, women who think badly about periods don't learn how to manage them so spend their life suffering with their periods.  2. See above, get over the brainwashing about menstruation and learn to appreciate your body, know that your periods show that you are healthy and fertile, your periods can bring about many good things such as feeling more energetic or more creative. Your periods also mean it is easier for you to get aroused, you can reach orgasms easier, multiple orgasms easier and deeper vaginal orgasms easier - this may not mean much now, but as you get older and when you start having sex you'll appreciate this all the more.  3. It can be normal, periods at the start are often very light, but for some women they are heavier, it's all down to hormones and right now your hormones are all over the place which is what causes problems. I'd strongly recommend that you don't use tampons, they are unhealthy and unhygienic which means they are putting your health and cleanliness at risk, but also they can increase menstrual flow, and you know yourself that they leak! See   for an idea of some of the health issues. I would strongly recommend that you use a menstrual cup, these are better than tampons in every way, and for women with heavy flow they are great because they hold more flow than tampons and don't leak! Menstrual cups are small flexible cups you wear during your period, they're much healthier and more sanitary than tampons so you can wear them for 12 hours as they collect flow rather than absorb and don't encourage bacterial growth, so no big risk of TSS or infections. They also hold more flow and have a light seal so don't leak, they can be used with any flow, overnight and while swimming so more convenient and reliable than tampons or pads. There is a good little article about cups on Scarleteen ", 10740, "fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa", 2],
