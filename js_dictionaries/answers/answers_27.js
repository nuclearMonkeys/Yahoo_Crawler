When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death.

	1383 : ["Not necessarily.   Some people who don't need eyeglasses are able to adjust their focus to compensate when they wear eyeglasses. Other don't have that ability. For someone who cannot adjust their focus to compensate, the answer to your question is almost \"Yes.\" When an object is out of focus in an image, points on the surface of the object will be disks in an image. The more something is out of focus, the larger the disks will be. For a given disk size, it doesn't make a difference if the focus is too close or too far. This what causes an out of focus object to be blurred in the image. For more information, google \"photography disks of confusion.\"  However, if a person with good eyesight wears eyeglasses made for a nearsighted person, the good eyesight person would be farsighted with those glasses. If a person with good eyesight wears eyeglasses made for a farsighted person, the good eyesight person would be nearsighted with those glasses.  Some people's eyes can adjust their focus to compensate for wearing corrective lenses they don't need. But, when that happens, the image they perceive is distorted. Straight lines look \"curved.\" The stronger the eyeglass correction, the more distorted things will look. Whether someone is able to adjust focus or not, wearing the wrong eyeglass prescription can cause eyestrain, with headaches. ", 229, "k7hBT7MGaa", 0],

There may be 1 in a major metropolitan city like Austin, Texas(about 20 across the state) but there are also many other food pantries that don't have the resources to handle the logistics that a regular food bank can.  Washington has about a BILLION POUNDS of potatoes that can't simply be dumped on 20 food banks.

	1395 : ["Yes, the COVID-19 stimulates your immune system to rpoduce, inter alia, antibodies. All antigens (anything that stimulates the immune system) do this. Your body is constantly detecting 'foreign bodies' and producing antibodies to them. Antibodies to one antigen do not prevent antibodies to another from working. There are no what you call 'natural non-specific antibodies'. All antibodies are specific. That is to ensure they only mount an immune response to a specific target. The COVID-19 vaccine will not be any use against other viruses. But, no vaccine is designed to be. So having a COVID-19 vaccine will not give you any protection against measles, Ebola or any other virus-caused disease. At the moment the COVID-19 vaccines seem to be effective against the known SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, the more people push back against the vaccine and the slower the vaccine programme is rolled out the greater the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate in ways which means the vaccines will not provide immunity to certain new variants.", 214, "kz04oBhsaa", 2],
