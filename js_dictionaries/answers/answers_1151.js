	63045 : ["The 60's. The main giants of the British Invasion: The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, and The Doors are among my favorites. The 70's also has some of my favorite bands, but I'm stripping his question down to a question of influence over musical quality, although I'll include both. The 60's essentially has some of the most important bands. The main five are among the most influential bands of all time, along with many other bands. Other very influential bands include the Stooges (though they only had one album in the 60's and two in the 70's), the band that was very influential to punk rock and heavy metal with its heaviness and speed, Bob Dylan, quite possibly the greatest lyricist to ever live, Jimi Hendrix, often called the greatest and most influential guitarist of all time, Bob Marley, the reggae genius, the Beach Boys, influential to pop and called America's band, the beginning of Led Zeppelin, quite possibly the most influential band to heavy metal, Cream, a heavy blues-influenced band, and several other people. Since a couple of those bands also found success in the 70's, I think the 70's would be considered the second \"best\" decade. It was influential, the beginning of heavy metal took place, punk rock, funk, etc. Also, many bands from the 60's found much success in the 70's. Then would come the 50's. The 50's had the blues, rockabilly, and produced great artists too, like Elvis, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf, etc. Afterwards would be the 80's. That was when pop was really sucking, and while heavy metal and alternative rock were great, both genres, along with punk rock, would create monsterous disasters in the music world. Punk became hardcore punk, which eventually became emo. Alternative rock would start becoming really bad after the grunge era, and heavy metal just began to fade away (though thrash lived on) and fused with other genres to create some pretty weird subgenres. Also, the development of hip hop took place, and bands were beginning to become corporate rock. Still, despite all the terrible things beginning to happen, it was a decent era for rock. The 90's was okay. Grunge was nice, and Radiohead was a good alternative rock band, along with R.E.M., which lived on. But by the late 90's, almost everything died.", 8188, "SEKyHMjYaa", 0],

	63047 : ["Ok,i never really understood that,too.But,i guess those people go for \"personality\" or something.I have a guy friend who's totally handsome,like,stunning,and he goes for plain looking,overweight girls.I was very surprised at that,since,he's got tons for pretty girls around him who want him.Though,he does seem to be preoccupied with appearance(not the metrosexual style,though,good thing),he goes for the not so attractive ones.And funny thing,he always finds himself  dumped by those same plain looking,overweight girls.Always broken-hearted and all.So,i don't get why doesn't he raise his standards in matters of beauty,since,it doesn't work with those girls,anyway...He could pick a pretty girl any time.And i've noticed the same with the pretty girls who get dumped and treated like crap by their not-so-good-looking boyfriends.It sucks.So,in the end,i guess,it's what they go for.Maybe they like to be the good-looking one in the relationship. With me,though,is different.I'm really picky,i'm not dying to have a boyfriend and i love being single.Not a problem,it's my full choice.I wouldn't date someone who's less attractive than me,because that \"chemistry\"s really important to me.I need to feel attracted to that person,and i seldom DO feel attracted to anyone...Because,well,i'm picky.I'd rather stay single forever than date someone i wasn't attracted enough to.I don't see all this pressure to have a boyfriend make sense.It doesn't.Why should i make such a compromise just because someone says it's \"normal\" to have boyfriends and date.It's not a must and i'm actually not even looking. It's also probably because they choose less attractive partners because  they're easier to be with.If they dated a pretty girl,it's known that a lot of the pretty girls who know they're pretty,tend to play harder to get and all that.And they also expect more.And also probably because they don't wanna have competition.So,it's more comfortable for them to be with someone less attractive.Same with the pretty girls who have ugly bfs.:)", 8183, "392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa", -1],

My take is the reason Sodam was destroyed was because they came on to Angels....some bibles even say wanted to rape them  My own personal view sex should not involve deceit, force, cheating on a spouse, or family members, or whips and strangulation..

	63059 : ["Because the listeners feel they had a line on how the band sounded first. When a band goes more mainstream, it offends some of the original audience. Sometimes I think it's the audience that needs to grow up. However, if you get too homogenized, the music loses its edge.

Some have speculated that Elvis and the Beatles could be 2-3 billion but it can't be verified and neither can the 1 billion. Elvis does have more gold and Platinum records than anyone else with 92 and 55 respectively. He does not however have 41 Grammy nominations, he has 14. He is the youngest recipient of the lifetime achievement award (36) and is the only artist in all 4 MUSIC halls of fame.

He does have the most successful album of all time, Thriller, which is a few million ahead of AC/DC's Back in Black.Michael Jackson did not call himself King of Pop, Elisabeth Taylor did, but he didn't dispute it like Elvis did. I do agree that Elvis is the best but you don't need to use exaggerated facts because the real facts show that he is the best. Both the Beatles and Michael Jackson are overrated by the average person and Elvis is underrated. Elvis is the measuring stick against witch all others are measured. This means that he is the best.
