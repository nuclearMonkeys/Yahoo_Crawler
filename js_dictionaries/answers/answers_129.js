The old school said, the producers will raise price to pay for the higher minimum wage. And if the price can move freely, it will come back to the equilibrium again. The case can only be done by monopolists. The normal producers who mostly have elastic demand curve cannot do that. So the other way is to reduce  cost, including some guys must go. Or the other best way is to increase productivity which will require huge investment. Or the last way, the producers declare bankruptcy.

When a business's expenses goes up (in this case by raising whatever they pay that is less than the new minimum wage to the new, higher, minimum wage), there's a choice: 1) Reduce expenses. This could mean laying off a few workers, cutting back on something else (reducing power use, etc.) or 2) Increase revenue by increasing the price of one or more products, or 3) Reduce \"margin\". Example: A business buys product for $2.00 and sells the product for $6.00 price. That $4.00 difference is \"margin\" and is what the business uses to pay salaries, benefits, utilities, rent, and all the other expenses the business has. What is left over after all the expenses are paid is profit. When margin is reduced, the ability for the business to stay in business is compromised. To answer your question, reducing margin and maintaining product price (no increase) due to raising the minimum wage is possible only if there is sufficient margin to cover the increase. Grocery and other retail margins are historically very thin. With little to no margin and after years of reducing expenses of non-payroll items, what is left is headcount reduction.", 1052, "HySNnkXAaa", 2],
