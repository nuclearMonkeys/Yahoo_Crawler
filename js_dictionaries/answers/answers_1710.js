	91187 : ["Like the other northern breeds, Siberian huskies have selectively bred for over 4,000 years to perform work for humans.  They have some fairly predictable traits that you need to consider. First and foremost, they are genetically driven to run and pull and as a consequence they require a LOT of exercise in order to maintain psychological as well as physical health.  You should be prepared to run your Siberian at least 5 to 10 miles each and every day.  Keep in mind that working Siberians on dog sled teams run anywhere from 50 to as many as 100 miles each day.   All huskies rank very high in the form of intelligence associated with problem solving.  As a consequence Siberians are very clever about escaping from confinement, and once they've done so they can run VERY far away from home.  Because they were developed by nomadic people, they don't have a particularly strong sense of home.  Those who developed the breed camped in a different place each night, so \"home\" just wasn't an important concept to them, or their dogs.  The result is a breed of dogs that are remarkable escape artists that are easily lost. Siberians are very independent thinkers.  As a result they can be difficult to train, and you'll need to find the best possible rewards to hold their attention and motivate them to do as you ask.  The best rewards for Sibes (and other northern breeds) are very tasty and stinky treats (bits of liver or fish), and an opportunity to run.   Siberians that are not allowed to run can develop obsessive behaviors, and will almost always find an outlet for that pent-up energy.  That outlet may exhibit as stereotypical pacing (running in laps or circles in a pen or on a tether), obsessive digging, destructive chewing (including any and all furniture available) and so forth.  They NEED a ton of exercise. Because of these traits, a disproportionate number of Siberians are available through rescue organizations and shelters - which means you can adopt an adolescent or maybe even a puppy for very little money, and give a needy dog a good home.  Just be aware that they are not \"easy\" pets and require a dedicated owner who understands their nature. Again like most northern breeds, Siberians are generally very healthy dogs with few veterinary issues.  Keep an eye on behavior and coat condition for signs of hypothyroidism, and watch out for vision problems that can be genetic.  Otherwise, they don't usually suffer from much in the way of genetic disorders.   Siberians are generally \"easy keepers\" which means they require less food than one would expect of a dog their size.  Be very careful not to over-feed your Siberian.  Learn how to judge your dog's body condition and adjust the amount you feed based on your dog's physical condition. Siberians usually don't display anything like \"human directed aggression\", but many Sibes are \"shy\" (moderately fearful of strange humans).  Any dog that shows fear of humans is a potential biter, and should be managed as such.  Sibes are slow to bond with new owners (up to a year), but once they do develop that bond they are incredibly loyal.   So, if you are an athletic person and interested in dog powered sports such as skijoring, bikjoring, skatejoring, scootering or canicross, and you are very patient and willing to accept the challenges of training a \"hard headed\" dog, you may be the perfect candidate for a Siberian.  If you aren't particularly athletic or you are an impatient sort, you'll be much happier with a more sedentary breed.", 9384, "Mw49Vjs6aa", 1],

	91206 : ["Hi!  Dogs have many problems that affect their skin, the largest organ of the body. The skin serves as a barrier to protect the body from infection, dehydration, caustic substances and ultraviolet light. The health and proper function of the skin is dependent on the health and proper function of the other organs in the dog's body. There are two categories of skin disease: primary and secondary. Primary skin diseases affect the skin directly, like mange or flea and tick hypersensitivity. Secondary diseases, such as hypothyroidism, initially involve other organs and later begin affect the skin. Click the link below for more information. Hope this helps.

	91207 : ["This appears to be a repeat of the flawed methodology of the 2004 Oserkes paper. I suspect this, like Oserkes (2004) will eventually be shown to have committed the fallacy of the biased sample. In any event, lets point out some of the more serious flaws: This and all similar studies contain several hidden assumptions. 1. It assumes that the population of papers accepted for publication are randomly distributed, I.e the peer review process is unbiased. We know from the experiences of Spencer, Lindzen and others, as well as Climategate that this assumption is invalid. 2. The data selection is not blind; Cook is about as rabid an alarmist as one can find. The assumption that he selected and rated the abstracts in an unbiased fashion is ...unlikely at best. 3. Given the 3500:1 funding advantage enjoyed by warmists over skeptics, it is likely that more papers will be published that endorse AGW simply because more of the get funding for the underlying studies. 4. Given the hostile reaction in academia towards skeptics, it is likely that a large percentage of non-tenured scientists avoid publishing anything that opposes the orthodoxy. 5. The 97.1% is of a culled data set. It is of only those who 'took a position'. This is the Texas sharpshooter fallacy. The same trick was applied in Doran Et al (2009) to get their 97% number. Finally, the whole exercise is invalid from its inception. It is an argumentum ad populum. It is an invalid argument designed to fool people who do not understand--or will not apply--the rules of logic. \"I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had. Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.\" —Michael Crichton, Aliens cause Global Warming [January 17, 2003 speech at the California Institute of Technology] \"It does not matter who you are, or how smart you are, or what title you have, or how many of you there are, and certainly not how many papers your side has published, if your prediction is wrong then your hypothesis is wrong. Period.\" --Richard Feynman, PhD, Nobel Laureate in physics The paper is junk science. @pegminer None of the above. All I am doing is picking specific non-sequiturs from warmist arguments and exposing them. It demonstrates to all concerned that your conclusion does not follow from your premise. I see that it upsets you, but that is inevitable; your angry response is further evidence that your position is held for emotional, rather than rational, reasons. It isn't personal, but you seem to be unable to make the separation between invalidation of your argument vs. invalidation of your person. That conflation is your doing, not mine. It is unfortunate, because I would like to have a rational give and take with you; but, you have made that impossible. Your (unspoken) ground rules are that I must not expose your invalid arguments; that is unreasonable, and I will not comply. BTW, the argument you used in the above barb towards me was an ad hominem tu quoque; it's not valid, either.", 9381, "dT0RYAOQaa", -4],
	91208 : ["I think things like this are a waste of time. Go to any scientific meeting and you'll see this without doing a study about it--the vast majority of earth scientists accept that AGW is real. I don't think you'll find any scientists that dispute that, even ones like Roy Spencer, Richard Lindzen, etc.,  realize that when they go to conferences they are in a small minority.  Scientists argue about the details, not the big picture. EDIT: Once again, Caliservative is using the very fallacies that he points out in others' arguments, but he seems quite happy to use in his own. There is no question that science is not about consensus--and when people talk about the scientific consensus, they are talking about using the consensus as a guide to public policy, not for deciding the science. So what type of rhetorical technique are you using Caliservative? Red herring? Straw Man? Misdirection? Another EDIT:  More \"Do as I say, not as I do\" from Caliservative. His response was pure projection, when he says \"I see that it upsets you, but that is inevitable; your angry response is further evidence that your position is held for emotional, rather than rational, reasons. It isn't personal, but you seem to be unable to make the separation between invalidation of your argument vs. invalidation of your person.\" Anything \"angry\" in my answer (see above) exists purely in his own mind--people can decide for themselves, it's there for everyone to read. Then he goes on to say  \"Your (unspoken) ground rules are that I must not expose your invalid arguments; that is unreasonable\" Actually, if you expose any invalid arguments of mine I think that's perfectly reasonable, but I have yet to see you do that. I think reasonable \"ground rules\" might be that you apply the same standards of argument to yourself that you do to others--but once again you've failed to honestly do that. I'm not surprised, Oh, and by the way, you are confused about what an \"ad hominem tu quoque.\"  fallacy is. To point out the inconsistency of your actions is not in itself an ad hominem tu quoque fallacy--it is just pointing out that you are hypocritical, it has nothing to do with the fallacy of your answer.  The fallacy of your answer is that you have made an argument that is irrelevant to the actual question--you have misconstrued \"scientific consensus\" as a consensus used in science--which it very much is not.", 9381, "AsKWImpQaa", 6],
