Nothing was stolen or broken and no one called the police, but it was a good night. I blacked out and barely remember a thing.

If you have no prior record, you might be able to keep out of jail.  Volunteer to give up your driving privileges for a short period of time (with a pass to go to and from work if there is no public transportation where you live), pay a fine, and do a boatload of community service.  If you've had a prior DUI, I would sell whatever you have to in order to get a lawyer, because you will probably not be able to get out of doing time. For the record, my friend's child was killed by a man who had been arrested for a previous DUI and given probation.  He didn't learn his lesson, got drunk, drove, and hit a car full of kids.  He's now doing 10 years for vehicular manslaughter, and will have to live with the guilt of killing three children for the rest of his life.

You're talking to some wrong lawyers if all they're acknowledging is that they can't get you out of it.

You can plead guilty and throw yourself upon the mercy of the court, if you choose.  Executioners aren't known for charity, though.  A guilty plea usually means maximum sentence.  There is no one single sentence for an offense.  Your lawyer could negotiate a minimum penalty, or at least, something much less than the maximum. As for learning your lesson?  Big deal.

A good DUI attorney will run you, well roughly $5K if i'm not mistaken. But if you talk to the P.A. in the D.A.'s office, they might cut you a break.

I can have sex for 7 hours non-stop on cialis... and I don't call the doctor after 4 hours of erection.. he will also be able to orgasm many times. Also, men are visual... use porn or something to keep his EYES focused on sex. Even if it's a few pics of you doing things... maybe a video of you masturbating. Concentrate your efforts on visual stimulus DURING sex... but you made a huge mistake... you think that sexy clothing does it... men like RAW DIRTY sex... the flowery stuff women think is sexy is actually a turn off to men. Have you tried being wild and dirty in bed. The best way to put a guy to sleep in the bedroom is to try and make sex emotional for them... sensual sex is such a turn off to most men. You are mistaken if you think that wild, kinky sex does not make a man connect to YOU... when a woman is wild and kinky, that is the very time when a man is most focuses on the actual woman he is with and not thinking about the hottie that does do kinky sex. If you want sex to be all about YOU, then kinky is your best bet... I can promise you that if your man is being sensual, 9 times out of 10 he is somewhere else having kinky sex in his mind... with a woman that LOVES kinky sex. If you are kinky... then you are the one he is thinking about.  I was a swinger for 5 years. I met a LOT of men who were candid about sex and how they operate. The only guys that fantasized about there wife were men who's wife was kinky, wild and wanted sex all the time... if their wife was not like that, they would ALWAYS be having sex in their mind with a woman like that... even if the body under them was their wife...

You should also get a styrofoam ice chest to keep them cold or use the fridge if you have one. I have seen people check into hotel holding 12, 24, or 30 packs of beer, like it was luggage.  And I have seen others, maybe college boys, wheeling around ice chests full of beer walking along the strip.

Walk onto any floor, in the middle of the hallway and there was music dancing, drinking, drugs, vomiting, you name it. At a certain point we couldn't even take the elevators anymore because there was vomit everywhere. It was actually really gross. So we all took the stairs (like 11 flights) up and down switching floors. I remember not knowing half the people in my actual hotel room. At one point someone was in it vomiting and I really had to pee so I had to knock on my neighbours door and use their washroom (who I didn't know by the way!). All in all it was hecticccc!! And checking out the next morning we heard like a bunch of tourists complaining and we later found out the hotel refunded everyone for their stays that weekend (that weren't part of the prom). Outside, smashed cars everywhere.. Cops got called several times but ended up doing nothing I don't even wanna know what happened there. Honestly I don't think you get crazier than that...
