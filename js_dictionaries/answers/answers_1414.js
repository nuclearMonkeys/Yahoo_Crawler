	76314 : ["My parents are struggling financially right now...to the point that their bank has issued a forclosure notice on their home and they are seriously considering declaring bankrupcy.  My mother has had a lot of medical problems over the years and the bills have added up. They met with a financial advisor to see if they could fix their budget so that they could afford to pay their bills.  Of course, the first thing the financial adviser suggested was to stop paying tithing...that would solve almost all their problems, he said.  My parents said 'no way'...tithing is not negotiable.  Well, it was tough, but they were able to work out a plan anyway.  Sure, it would have been easy to just cut out tithing...but my parents felt that the cost of doing so would have been greater than the monetary cost of paying the tithing.  I have no doubt that everything is going to work out for them and that they will be better off for having stuck with tithing than if they had decided to cut it. It's tough.  I recommend meeting with your Bishop about your concerns.  That's what my parents did when they were struggling with this and it made a huge difference and gave them hope.", 8827, "2ZO7vFC1aa", 4],
	76315 : ["I'm self employed so tithing is tricky because I never know exactly how much or when I'll be paid. Sometimes, my clients are late paying me and I do indeed get behind in paying my tithing. but I always work hard to get caught up. Right now, my business is suffering because of the slow economy. But instead of going completely hungry, we'll live on our food storage for a while and cut out any unnecessary expenses and continue to pay our tithing. My experience with not paying tithing is that unexpected expenses will suddenly arise - like car or appliance repairs, or medical bills, etc. I've learned that as long as I continue to pay it, those expenses seem to be fewer.", 8827, "ntFwCIcKaa", 4],
	76316 : ["I don't even like ranking. Grading is even more degrading in my opinion.  We are all so concerned with labeling and what others think of us and how they see us that we developed the ranking, then the subranking up to a rank and now the grading. It's so political now we even forget to train trying to sort out all the ranking and grading and who should be higher than who. Heck, we even have meetings about the ranking and the grading and since students make progress and it changes about every month there are meetings every month about this. What a waste of precious training time! I am so fed up with all this I don't care about the ranking anymore and I really don't care if I never get another rank in my life. For that reason I  am also not affiliated with any organization anymore. I am learning much more this way, have a lot less to worry about and therefore am much happier. BTW we have a saying in my dojo: \"Shut up and train!\". There is a lot of wisdom in that one. Sorry for the rant but you got me started. @David: Actually 'player' is a proper term in chinese martial art. Can't say I like the term much either since we think of football or something like that when we hear the term but our English language is too limited to have a good translation. Also teacher and Sensei in Japanese or Laoshi in Chinese are the same. No special significance is given to this. It is not a title but the way you address a person in asia. A person would never ever refer to themselves as Sensei or Laoshi. You can be a Sensei or Laoshi in anything you teach not just martial art. You can be a mentor to someone and they may address you as Sensei or Laoshi.", 8833, "d503428496b7275f70c66859957bdd07aa", 3],
	76317 : ["This is part speculation since I cannot find a definite answer on the topic, but it may have developed from the students in a McDojo, treating their tests as something they are \"graded on\", like a class in school.  ---   I looked at a couple language translators, seeing how \"testing\" and \"grading\"  translated from English to other languages (Japanese, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean) and back, however it didn't help me find an answer either. The other possibility may fall in the area of people training martial arts with a 'sports emphasis'.  I don't like to see that as a primary focus of teaching or wanting to learn, but I can't control the actions of others in that regard.", 8833, "AA11101806", 0],

	76326 : ["Tithing isn't paid by all Christians in the same way. They give what they can spare and you don't have to go to the priest and explain anythign.

It's sad really.", 8827, "None", 1],
	76327 : ["in order to pay tithing, you need to sacrifice in other areas in your life. Like no cable or a cheaper car. Paying tithing takes sacrifice. You can't expect to be fine when your paying tithing and then ask for everything else other people have like the nice house or that boat. Live within your means. PLEASE -what a joke- , no one is in the situation to either pay tithing or let your kid starve to death. We always put less important things first. I don't need my 2 brand new cars or my cell phones or my cable or whatever else. If my money becomes tight, sacrifice the cell phone, not the tithing. Food is always first I am the king when it comes to getting out of financial debts. i was $27,000 just in credit card debt 2.5 years ago. I only earned 40,000 a year.

	76328 : ["I live close to Omaha, not too close though but close enough, and I've heard many things about the ATA, both in praises and disgust. To hear my instructor tell it, \"grading\" most definitely came from the ATA. Anyone who calls testing grading gets an ear full from him. He says the term grading didn't technically come from the ATA themselves but rather the uneducated parents (uneducated in terms of martial arts, anyway) of the kids attended who began calling it grading and it caught on so the instructors began saying it. If you look at an ATA testing ceremony, it is very much a grading and not a testing whatsoever. They don't have to know everything to pass, just good enough. Youtube video and youtube video will show their \"grading/testing\" and it looks like a class for students on their first day there. At the end, countless ones of them are rewarded belts that are apparently high up on the ranking system (according to the color belt scheme on the ATA's website and wikipedia page). If it didn't start with the ATA there's no doubt in my mind it was started by parents with little kids in a school with crappy instructors. I really don't think it's a translation problem, just a misconception by people not properly educated.", 8833, "Q8HOyNTGaa", 1],
	76329 : ["I tend to agree with you and to me it is just a modern word spawned by McDojos to help keep their little munchkins from having anxiety over \"testing\" and what that word implies. I have also seen articles that among other things recommended using that term instead of \"testing\" for those reasons to school and studio owners.  I still use the term \"testing\" and if they can't handle the pressure of that and what that implies then they certainly are not ready to test and sugar coating it will not change that.  I guess for some schools where promotions are basically automatic though its one more way for an instructor to justify testing and promoting someone and lining their pockets with several thousand dollars each year in testing fees.", 8833, "2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa", 0],
	76330 : ["The first place I ever heard the term in relation to Martial arts was an ITF McDojang at the local YMCA. I didn't regularly hear it until I joined Y!A. I put it with other BS terms, like player, gym, and coach. I personally can't stand any of the three terms. I agree totally that it is testing, belt testing or rank testing, but grading isn't even good use of the language. A person that teaches Martial arts is a Sensei, Instructor or at the very least a Teacher. A school is a Dojo or Dojang, school, or class it is not a gym. I know you know this but you asked and that is one of my pet peeves. Edit: I may be wrong but my understanding of translation of the term Sensei actually translates as \" One who has gone before\". Player I could see in the context of a sport oriented art or combat sport.", 8833, "Lwgi5Wnzaa", 1],

	76333 : ["A lot of women have issues with their self image because of the media and such, some are raised to wear it, some try to hide their flaws. It does not objectify anyone/anything by applying make up to ones face. By that logic doing anything to yourself is objectifying e.g. eating food. I do not like makeup because it's fake and I want a woman who is inherently attractive because I feel her value is higher than someone who has to use makeup to get the same look. Guys can't wear makeup to hide their flaws, at least for the most part without getting made fun of, so I also think that it's unfair. If a woman has to wear makeup all the time I feel she is insecure and hiding flaws which is unattractive to me. Just like how their is no one race, one hairstyle, one clothing style, one that all women find attractive in men there is no one thing that all men like. Some guys have grown up around people who wear makeup all the time and therefore like women with makeup.

	76337 : ["The Arizona Diamondbacks and the San Diego Padres are both very good teams and would have put up a better fight than the Angels did against the Red Sox. The Rockies really really believe in themselves and I am pretty sure they will figure out a way to get the hits needed to win.   I do not expect a \"rusty\" team to show up in the AL park next week -  I think they can-do-it and win the World Series - maybe even go 4-0", 8841, "ZCNEm9hTaa", 0],
	76338 : ["One of the reasons the Rockies have been doing so well is that starting September 16 they have been playing for their playoff lives.  So while other teams who already clinched were resting certain players, the Rockies had to play all the way through a play-in game just to win the Wild Card.  That competitive nature has caused them to just go on a tear through the post season.  However, with 8 days now to rest, it's going to slow them down.  This will be their biggest rest this year.  The Indians and Red Sox are in a grind and will be playing up until the World Series is about to start.  So they will have some of that same fortune the Rockies had.  They will be playing competitively through the World Series while the Rockies have cooled off.  AL wins the World Series in 6. EDIT:  El Cestriano -  You should ask this question by itself and not hi-jack another question.  But to answer it just because the teams are all from North America, the athletes are from all over the world (Japan, South America, etc...)", 8841, "53bbf49abd80f00d35e39bf753c77e77aa", -2],
	76339 : ["You gotta talk to your bishop--if you are just plain out of money, the church will help you with food and bills. I have been there and done that, too. I am a veteran and I am a single mom of three kids--I live on my VA for right now. My ex ditched me--that's another story. (maybe the best thing that's happened to me, in hindsight.) I pay tithing on my meager little allowance every month--it hurts. It especially hurts when I paid on my tax returns. I have a testimony of tithing, but I figured that I would fudge on it a little until I got on my feet. But not so. Then I met a really wonderful gentleman who asked me to marry him--in the temple. We can't do this until my kids get out of school, then I will move to where he is. As soon as he proposed, I talked to my bishop about him (I have been burned before, a girl can't be too careful) and the first thing the bishop told me to do was to keep paying an honest tithe so that I could go to the temple worthily. I was like \"yeah, yeah, how about 'congratualations, Mary.\"  But then I got home, called my fiance and he told me the same thing. I did do this. I have made sure of it, even if it killed me. The first thing that happened, I got a suprise check in the mail for $1,200: Recently discovered back-pay from the army. (When does Uncle Sam let any money slip out of his clammy little hands willingly?\") Now, I was not able to run to the mall and go shoe-shopping, of course. That was barely enough to get me by, but get me by it did. No one is hungry at my house. My fiance pays tithing faithfully each week--he's a convert of three years, but he says this is one principle the he readily accepted off the bat. Just today, he called and told me that his company got a new bid and just from this, his salary will increase by $500 a week, and he is being promoted--just in time to put two girls through college (one of his and one of mine) and raise two of his and two of mine at home for another couple of years. I'm so excited--my finances allowed me to finish school (my last final is tomorrow) and I will be ready to work in a new career as soon as we are settled. There's only a 1% unemployment rate where he lives and I am almost sure to have a good position right away. I blame our narrow success on paying tithing.  No, it hasn't been easy, and it's not going to be easy, but I guarantee that even if you make $10, giving one back to the Lord is going to bring you more blessings than if you keep it all.

	76340 : ["I have always referred to this as a test.  To 'test' the skills of the individual, but have heard it referred to as a 'grading' for years now.  I think it may have as much to do with translation as anything else.  Also, as you say, the belt-mills have often changed or warped terminology.  I don't know which has caused that name change, but I still use the term test. edit: reading that others only first heard this term here on Answers, made me wonder, if this originates here in Canada.
