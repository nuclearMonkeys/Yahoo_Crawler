	95537 : ["New York Giants. I was wondering the same thing... they dropped below the cap, yet let Boss and Smith. I wonder how Osi's \"knee injury\" is going. Eli Manning and Tony Romo are two of the most unappreciated QB in the NFL in my opinion. Oh yeah, and Prince got injured in his first New York Giants practice ever... not good", 9549, "AXI0qtLPaa", 1],

I have used the orange acne body wash since the age of 14 and it works just as well for me now as it did then... But again, every person is different...  If your skin gets used to something then keep 3 or 4 products under the cabinate and rotate every few weeks. As long as you don't use them one on top of another you should be fine.", 9550, "None", 0],
	95542 : ["Once you find a good face regime stick to it. Every two weeks is not good - as it takes about 30 days to really adjust to a regime. If you break out implement a nice acne wash to your routine as needed to help with occasional blemishes. I love Arbonne (I use the anti aging line) and if I break out I just switch over to their acne wash to help. I like Clinique's 3 step I used to use that for many years.", 9550, "VCYwuVguaa", 0],
	95543 : ["Don't make laugh. You do realize the reason why he's ranked as the second wide receiver out of the draft, is because of his special teams, punt returns,  and wide receiver combo..right? Hakeem Nicks and Brian Robiskie are better receivers than Maclin. McNabb will make him look good though.", 9551, "jTKxLFuWaa", -3],
	95544 : ["I'm not so sure Reggie has a better matchup.  The Giant secondary can be exploited, as we saw Sunday with a b/u QB.  Peyton has been struggling in recent weeks, mainly due to a running game even worse than usual, the loss of Clark, and nonstop injuries to his WRs.  I'd go with the hot hand. And I agree on \"must starts\".  Never pay attention to that type of comment.  If you want a good source that gives you info you need to make up your own mind, read Evan Silva's matchups at Rotoworld  They come out late in the week, but that's all I use now, because too many of these \"gurus\" chase big names.", 9551, "Ohcyim3Kaa", 0],

When choosing a defense, you have to consider which team has the better offense. Obviously this would be the Giants. The pressure won't be on the Giants D to win Football games. The Bears have Rex Grossman and Kyle Orton battling for the starting job....come dude, the Bears O is horrible, they'll depend on their D to win games week in and week out. Giants are clearly one of the top Defenses in the league....and they're better this year with the maturation of many of their young players i.e. Aaron Ross.", 9549, "2YFE92DSaa", 0],
