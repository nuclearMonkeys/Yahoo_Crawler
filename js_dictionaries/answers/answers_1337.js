A large part of the problem is that they rely too heavily on outside research when it comes to approving substances - which is really easy to manipulate {{y'know... shadowy stats shaving skills, changing operational definitions post-hoc, etc}} 2) Those substances do not fall under the \"D\" in F.D.A, but rather the \"F\" - they are considered food supplements - which is why they are exempt from the regulations that drugs are subject to.....and yet they are not subject to periodical safety and compliance inspections by the USDA who would normally cover such things (farms, bottling plants, grocers, restaurants - you would be surprised) - because they aren't exactly 'food' either..... Bill Clinton in trying to appease a bunch of folks (with millions of signatures and lots of lobbyists) who were afraid that their freedom to take Vitamin C would be taken away stuck supplements in a nebulous 'grey area'. He did manifest the structure/function claims laws - so at least companies can't make ridiculous claims but can rather only say things like Vitamin A supports visual health.**(a)  3) I have seen lots, and lots of health care products - where I worked we had 30,000 on the floor and as a buyer I would say a few hundred new ones used to cross my desk every month I've never seen a  claim to cure cancer or the like - its always got some sketchy language that can be abused by shyster sales people who take advantage of others...but so help me - if those labels do say such things, I hope the Feds go after them with vengeance and fury.... {{Now, you are probably wondering how homeopathics can make all sorts of claims to treat, x, y, or z....they have their own US Pharmacopoeia - so they are, but not quite drugs either - and exempt from both sets of rules -  that decision was made sometime during the civil war - I'm not even going to go off on a rant about China - they think its okay to kill their own people, so surely they don't care about people in other countries... 4) Many of those substances are toxic in the wild, let alone a capsule - we have the freedom to demand poisons here y'know?  5) The FDA doesn't have jurisdiction over in China, as far as I know we can't inspect a single plant there - someone at NBC got a fact wrong. 6) Many of the larger companies in the supplements fields got together because they were afraid that Clintons new US standards would tarnish their image - so they created one that was far higher - its known as GMP (Good Manufacturing Process) Canada adopted it as their national standard because it was so stringent. You guys in the UK too if I recall right (though its been a while) - so anyone here who has actually done some research would know only to buy GMP certified products.

The Laštovička 2004 paper (and the 2006 paper, which I believe used the upper atmosphere trends ending in 1997) mentions that geomagnetic and solar activity have played some role in the cooling upper atmosphere, but there hasn't been any particularly good assessment of the extent of their roles. And increased water vapor likely makes up a majority of the rest. Maybe CO2 is playing a role, and it is likely, but we just don't know. Beyond that, the SSU data shows a lack of cooling for at least 12 years at altitudes of 50km--well into the upper stratosphere and generally high enough to remove the influences of the H2O/ozone interaction. Above that, we have no temperature record, and I have yet to see a more up to date assessment of the trends. \"The higher up one goes, the more important the CO2 related cooling is. It's interesting to note that significant solar forcing would have exactly the opposite effect (it would cause a warming) - yet another reason to doubt that solar forcing is a significant factor in recent decades.\" Read the climate commitment studies of Wigley, et al, and Meehl, et al, to understand how the argument that recent solar activity has not increased is simplistic and wrong. If the level of solar forcing reached prior to 1940 continues (which is unlikely per Solanki), then there will be a solar contribution to the energy imblance resulting in sea level rise for several more centuries. Presumably most of the temperature response occurs in the first few decades, although arguably, that response was delayed by the causes of the midcentury cooling (aerosols, among other things).", 8681, "fG34EKYWaa", 0],

One of the main problems with many supplements is possible contamination (especially supplements and products that come from the far east). I am not sure why the FDA lack the power to regulate such supplements. The problem is, the alties don't like the words \"regulate\" or \"authority\" they interpret it to mean they are being controlled and having their choice taken away from them (this is all part of their paranoia).

	72475 : ["Yeah, I hear this argument a lot; “the stratosphere is cooling, just look at this graph.” But, (and I'm prepared to accept that I'm hallucinating, or something, here) I just don't see it. Let's analyse the graph in your second link… The graph starts in 1958 and shows cooling until about 1971. From 1971 until 1982 the cooling stops completely or even reverses slightly. Then in 1982 we get the El Chichon volcanic eruption which causes a sudden rise and fall that completely obscures the natural trend. Clearly there has been a sudden and dramatic drop between the before and after temperatures. When the effects of the El Chichon eruption end in about 1985 we then see very slight warming for about 6 years until about 1991 when we get the Pinatubo eruption. Again, the Pinatubo eruption results in a sudden rise and fall that completely obscures the natural trend and, once again, there is a sudden and dramatic drop between the before and after temperatures. After Pinatubo we see cooling from 1994 until about 1998. Finally, from 1998 to the present we see no cooling at all, if anything there is a very slight warming trend. So, we are lead to believe that the steadily increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere should cause a steady cooling of the stratosphere as more and more outgoing radiation is prevented from reaching it. However, you are showing a graph covering 50 years that, outside of the effects of volcanic activity, only shows cooling for 17 years, while showing no trend or warming for 26 years. Thus, it is not immediately obvious from your graph that continuous, steady stratospheric cooling is actually happening.  It seems to me that since 1971, outside of the effects of volcanic activity there has been very little stratospheric cooling and none at all over the last 10 years when CO2 levels have been rising faster than ever. Keith, could you educate me as to exactly where this supposed CO2-induced cooling is on your graph?", 8681, "a85bd4d28281b52b7bdecfc33cd65da3aa", 1],
