	128520 : ["I never heard that expression but it surely makes sense to me. The older I get, the more water runs off my back. You just can't take anything too seriously, especially when you're on the computer.", 10985, "None", 1],
	128521 : ["When you consider the fact that airplanes weigh tons and tons and tons, it really doesn't make much sense. Maybe the saying dates back to an era when airplanes weren't yet even thought of. Geez, I don't know!", 10985, "EMnvCdjqaa", 1],
	128522 : ["Yes, I do believe in miracles and have been at the receiving end of God's miraculous healing, as well as seeing miracles elsewhere. Your comments bring to mind Mark 6 v 5 -- Jesus did not perform many miracles in His home town because people did not believe. Perhaps it is because people don't expect miracles to happen that they don't see them in their lives.", 10986, "9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa", 2],
	128523 : ["Let me start by saying that I am a devout Christian and am living as right as I possibly can.  Now, I believe in miracles and have them happen to me all the time.  I'll give an example of one of my events and you decide if it is a miracle or not.  I am a single parent that works and goes to school.  God told me to skip a semester of school and focus on my music.  I agreed to do so, put my cell phone on vibrate, turned it off, and went into the library.  Once I sat down at a computer my phone rang as loud as it could.  It was a friend of mine, who just got back from Afghanistan, that owns a recording studio.  He asked me what was up with my music, I told him what I needed, and we met when I got back to my home state.", 10986, "mpucrSR4aa", 3],

	128525 : ["Neither. A virtual piÃ±ata doesn't sound like too much fun...without a gimmick, like random items each time. Just make it a web applet and it'll be a fun time-waster to see what you get from it. You could even set up accounts, and make it a collection-type thing, have different objects appear at different rates, with leaderboards and semi-constantly updated content. Fun fun fun. Good luck!", 10991, "B3fo8t8faa", 1],

	128528 : ["It's the overall career and the QB rating. Peyton is still better. Playing on a pass oriented team helps a lot and of course he has played longer. If Eli hits 300 career TD's it might make a difference. It's regular season stats, wins, passing percentage...Super Bowls won comes in later, it would take 3 or 4 to convince me. I compare Eli to Bradshaw..he was a chump before he started winning SB's..now he's all time great.", 10981, "iPWKzzQtaa", 2],
	128529 : ["Good question.  Damn, won't Archie be disappointed.  I always wished the Chargers stuck to their guns and kept Eli, regardless of him saying he would sit out the season.  But Peyton is at a level of gameplay that Eli will still take a few more seasons to develop.  I almost have to say no... but shoot... It's all about the rings, right?", 10981, "aa30097e8a8b6000ee807296e82bc381aa", 0],

	128534 : ["I never saw that movie, but I remember the song VERY well. Needless to say, it was GREAT! Unfortunately, based on the song he sang to the shrink \"..I wanna kill. I wanna kill. I wanna see burnt dead bodies...I wanna kill...\" And it was then that the shrink pinned a medal on him and said \"you're our boy!\" Based on that, I'm guessing he would have wound up in VietNam. Whether he made it back safely is anybody's guess. As for the movie showing on regular TV, I don't think that it's necessarily too radical, it's probably just more than a little dated.", 10988, "02405b4ea4b4a3e2fdaf4ba004553c8caa", 1],
	128535 : ["I have had too many miracles in my life not to believe in them.  Divine intervention for sure.  I have witnessed miracles of protection when someone I worked with was trying every way to get me into trouble and everything she did backfired on her.  My car broke down on the freeway.  I accepted a ride from a stranger (a man).  He warned me before I got out of the car never to take a ride with another stranger.  (Angel or serial killer?)  I do not know.  There are numerous occasions where my husband or family could have been killed and we were not.  Our car broke down in Florida on a Sunday returning from Disney World out in the boondocks, and nothing around.  A nice man was driving by, took my husband to get a part for our VW, brought it back, put it on for us, and just told us to pass the favor along which we have done since that time.", 10987, "FcDr9LHraa", 1],
	128536 : ["certain, I do matter on miracles and performance been on the receiving end of God's unbelievable therapeutic, besides as seeing miracles elsewhere. Your comments bear in mind to recommendations Mark 6 v 5 -- Jesus did not carry out many miracles in His homestead city because human beings did not trust. per chance that is because human beings do not assume miracles to ensue that they don't see them of their lives.", 10987, "nMD21gjdaa", 0],
	128537 : ["Yes I have witnessed miracles in my life. My first miracle was when I had my first child after being married almost five years and the doctor telling me I could not have children. Such joy!! The second miracle was a death defying motorcycle crash on I-95 going to Florida 4 years ago. We really both should have died (hubby and I) but survived. We were bumped off the road by an RV when it came over in our lane. We were traveling almost 75 miles an hour when we ran off the road. I was in bad shape and had to be air-lifted to a hospital 30 miles away. Hubby had a broken leg and was taken by ambulance to the same hospital. To me these both were miracles.

	128547 : ["There are no such things as miracles. So-called miracles have ALWAYS occurred in times and in places, and were observed by people, who were inclined to believe them to be real. People like to slap the word on unexplained events or on things that happen against long odds. In neither case can these events be shown, in any way, to be the result of some kind of supernatural or divine intervention. Mysteries are not miracles. When an amputee stands in Times Square at noon and, being recorded by dozens of TV cameras, mysteriously grows back an arm, then I'll believe in miracles.", 10986, "yX7fVGWLaa", -1],
	128548 : ["I see them every single day.  My health insurance looked like it was going to be canceled (and I'm having surgery in a week and a half)....but I was re-assured by the caseworker that it is not going to be canceled.  My mother came home yesterday from the hospital where they only found an infection and put her on anantibiotics but she's doing well.  After being once denied for disability, got it without a hassle after my dr. signed the form that I am (temporarily) disabled. And that's just to name a few. I may not have seen an amputee \"healed\" but I have in Africa seen a man prayed to literacy.  He couldn't read and God made him literate. .In traveling around the World God ALWAYS provided for us, when our van broke down or we needed Housing. He always came through.  ALWAYS. Edit....I'm waiting on a miracle.  I have been told there is NO Way my insurance will pay for me to be in a place for care after my surgery on 4/19/10, but I know God has NEVER let me down before and He's going to step in and make a miracle where there seems to be no way. I don't know how, but He knows and will provide.  There is no Human way possible.  Now it's up to God to make it happen", 10986, "AA11686091", 2],
