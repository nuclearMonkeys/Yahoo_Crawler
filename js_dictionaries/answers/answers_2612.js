	136432 : ["1) Who is a better wrestler? Ted. I mean , I love cody and all. But his ring skills aren't good. 2) Who do you think is the first to become world champion.? Ted. Because I heard he was going to turn face;you know , for his movie and all. So he is gonna get a hige push. 3)Who has a brighter future? Ted. I think he is a great wrestler and not so bad mic skills, also that push thing I mentioned earlier. 4) Who is more athletic? Ted. He is a great wrestler. 5) Cody. I'm not sure why, I just think that the way he talks is more believable than Ted. Ted's not bad though...", 11322, "4c36c6bc64acdc865b196a635a6a5590aa", 0],
	136433 : ["Ted DiBiase Jr. is much, much better in the ring, no doubt about it. He's actually managed to impress me in the ring unlike Cody, who has been with the WWE longer.  What is a 'chamption'? If you mean champion, I think Ted will bcome World Champion way before Cody. In fact, I don't see Cody as World Heavyweight Champion, he just doesn't look like the guy for the job, he's too skinny and weak-looking.  Once again, Ted has more potential, much more potential. I actually mark for Ted, he's unique and just has a certain something. He oozes confidence.  Again, this goes to Ted. He's stronger so he can do more stuff and his move set is much better than Cody's.. I like Dream Street.  Cody is better on the mic despite the lisp.
