You are doing the right thing by wanting to compromise!  If she cannot afford to drive that far every week, how does she expect you to do it?  Not to mention the extra time involved in your workday to drive both ways.  At least you aren't asking her to drive both ways!   I would just tell her, \"Sorry, but the amount I would then spend on gas driving back and forth is the same as the cost of an extra day of daycare.  By driving back and forth, that is a longer day for me and less time I have to spend with my son.  If you want to watch him, that is great and I appreciate it, but then you have to accept some sort of compromise.\" My mom lives an hour away and she sees my daughter at least once a week, and watches her whenever daycare is closed and I need her to.

Just tell her that you would absolutely love for her to be able to continue watching him that one day, but that it would be much easier on you and your fam if you put him in daycare for that day as you don't have the extra time in the morning to drop him off. I personally though, would make the extra effot to have her watch him, only because i would not in any way, shape, or form trust a complete stranger with a 6 month old baby that would not be able to tell me if anyone did anything bad or inappropriate to him at daycare.

So here are the options, all laid out, and if it doesnt work out for her, then your son  will just go to daycare and she can come visit when she is able to\" This is not about her and she is being very selfish. Dont twist your entire life around to accommodate her whims. You have a job to do, a family to take care of and you have to make sure your son isnt driving all day long as well. Thats not fair on him.  You are not being unreasonable. Let her be irritated, she will get over it.

At 3 years of age it is possible that they may be able to do that. This test will only let you know if they have a colour vision problem...not what it is or how severe it is.

The title pretty much explains it - it's about a group of girl's who run a baysitter's club and you get lots of different stories all about each of them. Spooksville or Goosebumps books - Again loved these, they're creepy but not scary or anything. Jacqueline Wilson books especially The Lottie Project, Double Act, The Illustrated Mum and The Bed and Breakfast Star. They're all really good stories and I think they deal with things that younger people go through without being too adult. Garth Nix is also really good I think for younger readers probably the Keys to the Kingdom series that starts with Mister Monday. The Artemis Fowl books by Eoin Colfer - it's got faeries and things and is a good fantasy series. The Wish List is also good.", 10338, "AA11701659", 0],

It's about a teenage girl in Arkansas during World War II when some German Army prisoners are brought to a camp nearby.  She ends up befriending him to the point of falling in love.  It is also an excellent description of life in the South in the 1940s.  As I remember, there was also at least one sequel.  I think my copy of the book says its about a Grade 6 reading level. I also agree about the Nancy Drew books.  And there are so many that Nancy Drew could be what your daughters read all summer!  I especially like the combination Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys mysteries.  They might be best for your older daughter. For your younger daughter, the \"Babysitter's Club\" series by Ann M. Martin might be best.

	113204 : ["No. I don't care if the Republican POTUS nominee is a woman (not just VP) I will NEVER vote Republican. EDIT-Max is just bitter that his candidate's desperate attempts at pandering won't work....and that Obama will be our next President! Haha! EDIT-Max, if you understand your history, you know that what was \"Republican\" during the American slavery era, is \"Democrat\" now. The Republicans during the time of Lincoln were the social liberals, and the Democrats were the social Conservatives. This switched around the time of FDR. Many Democrats during Desegregation probably DID vote against it... but this is because many Southern social conservatives refused to switch parties because of their hatred for Lincoln. It was only in the last couple of decades that socially conservative states in the South began going to the Republican candidates....and it was the issue of the Rebel Flag, and republicans racist support of it, that swayed them.  It was the Democrat leaders, however, that brought about desegregation, and it was the Republican leaders in the House and senate that opposed it. Remember Trent Lott ran for President, and keeping segregation alive and well was the biggest part of his platform. I'm from the South. Racists vote Republican, without fail. In fact, I remember having a conversation with a \"friend\" when I was in high school about politics. We couldn't vote, obviously, but I told her I was a Democrat, and she said she was a Republican. I asked her why. She said \"Because my daddy says that Democrats want to give rights to the 'n*****s.'\" I was appalled (and not her friend for very much longer). Mind you, this was only ten yrs ago.
