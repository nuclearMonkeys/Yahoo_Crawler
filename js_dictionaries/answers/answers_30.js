And that's way different from NJ or virtually anywhere east of the Mississippi River.  At 80 F in NJ your perspiration stays on the skin because the surrounding air is humid and saturated with moisture.  And that's actually a good thing because when the breezes blow across you that causes the perspiration to evaporate and carry off the heat that your body has.  You don't have that in AZ during a heat wave; so the risk of heat stroke is higher even at lower temperatures because it's dry heat.", 233, "74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa", 1],

	1545 : ["Per Wikipedia's \"Virus\" there are 6 BASIC STAGES in viral replication: attachment (to the surface of the host cell it invades), penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, release  The REPLICATION STAGE \"involves primarily multiplication of the genome\"; and viral protein synthesis is followed by \"viral genome replication\". From these it is clear that indeed the end product is not just protein material but genetic, or nucleic acid, material. We should distinguish between 2 types of viruses: DNA virus & RNA virus. If DNA type, genome replication usually takes place in the host cell's nucleus; if RNA type, in that cell's cytoplasm—where of course the ribosomes are located. Incidentally, the COVID virus (SARS-CoV-2) is the RNA type. And \"all RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genes\" From the foregoing, I think it's safe to conclude the host cell's ribosomes do manufacture nucleic acids as well as proteins when invaded by a virus. Whereas  in normal conditions they'd produce only protein material, since there is no need to replicate their own genome (which  theyre able to do as a matter of course in the process of cell division) What's more, what could be more intriguing is that it appears the host cell could produce the viral copies—nucleic acid, protein & all—without even using ribosomes! This in the case of DNA virus. For while there are millions of ribosomes in the host cell's cytoplasm, so far as is known none are present in its nucleus nor in the protoplasm that houses it", 260, "None", 0],

	1547 : ["Whom do I contact about Jews and freemasons (aka homosexual devilworshipping Jew-masons) killing 70 million in Soviet Union by gulags, famine, or shooting squads? How can Russian Orthodox get some justice? Russian Orthodox Metropolitan Ioann Snychev was poisoned/murdered by Jew Putin (aka Shalomov) because he refused to work for Jews. KGB poisoned Putin; Putin died in 2007; now doubles (who wear latex masks) pretend to be Putin. Medvedev is David Aaronovich Mendel. Jews murdered Tsar Nicolas 2nd's family; Jews bled them for six hours according to ritual. Tsar Nicolas' family was sacrificed by Jews (they bled 6 hours); their remains were burnt; their blood drank; ashes from remains were sprinkled onto 50 hard-boiled eggs (dish called scido Amafreikis) [50 egg shells were found outside the place of ritual murder]. Also, decapitated Tsar's head (which was grey ... hair turned grey when he saw his kids being knifed).. Ritualistic murder... (blood libel is same thing as anti-Semitism ... a lie by Jews to flee justice). Jews came up that Tsar's family was shot. Tsar appeared to warn that whosoever worships false remains will become possessed by demons (this just happened like a decade ago ... maybe less)… Jews collect heads of leaders because they believe in reincarnation. How about Jews coming up with a mocking holiday April 1st because resurrection of Jesus happened on that day? Jews came up with mocking holidays 23 February (Day of Soviet Army) which was capitulation by cowards in Tsar's army… or March 8 (international Woman's day) which celebrates lesbian/prostitute Klara Tsetkin and Rosa Luxembourg. Three biggest saints in heaven (in this order): Theotokos Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, and Tsar Nicolas 2nd Four biggest sinners in hell (in this order from the bottom of hell moving up to our level): Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin You could joke that Marx is a bigger sinner than Engels because Marx fooked Engels but how is Lenin a bigger sinner than Stalin when Lenin was fooked by Zinoviev (even by Bronstein once)? Lenin's brain was the size of walnut. He had syphilis. Was alcoholic. Born from incest degenerate family. Was in insane asylum. Wife Kruspkaya was probably lesbian 'cause what normal woman would stay with him? According to Russian Orthodox researcher Grigoriy Klimov, three stages of degeneracy are 1)sodomy (69, anal, oral, masturbation, pedophilia, incest, necrophilia, beastiality, orgies, hand job, bj, even all non-missionary positions between husband and wife, etc.) 2)insane asylum 3)physical deformities in kids (eyes looking at different angles, wolf jaw, rabbit lip, horse foot, different length limbs, etc.) all these accompanied by drug/alcohol abuse Jews have like six times more degenerates than other nations because they don't have monkhood. Jewish degenerates become politicians (or similar high rank in society). In Germany during Hitler time, it was eight times. Hitler, Stalin (aka Jugashvilli which means son of Jew), Roosevelt, Churchill were all Jewish degenerates. Hitler had many Jewish coworkers as homosexual partners. Stalin was expelled from seminary for sodomy. A few centuries ago, angel appeared to Orthodox Christian community and said not to buy from Jews at bazaar because it's sprinkled with blood (something like that) Those were facts… and now for some Conspiracy Theory: Elimination of comments on Yahoo Answers means that Project Pogo is completed. Now, Project Zyphr will initiate in winter. They will turn off electricity for a few days to gather dissidents into underground concentration camps. DRONE WITH SCOPOLAMINE will drill a hole in your window and once gassed you will come out to them yourself. AI (Artificial Intelligence) will make phone calls and posts on social media as if it were you doing it (and no one will notice that you're gone). The remaining people will be chipped.
