This is a very long process, it involves a lot of red tape to go through and it is expensive!!!  You need to be interviewed, he needs to be interviewed, you need to provide documentation, bank statements, proof of how long you have known each other, proof of any visits.   After they were married he still could not work for another six months. You going to England isn't going to make it any easier or cheaper to do.  My niece is married to a guy from England.  They are in limbo right now and have spent many weeks apart. To stay on England they must earn a specific amount of money, which they don't have. They up and got married in the USA on the spur of the moment. Then tried to go through the process of visas and moving. Do not do it this way.  And unless you are married first, chances of you getting a job and then moving are slim to nil.
