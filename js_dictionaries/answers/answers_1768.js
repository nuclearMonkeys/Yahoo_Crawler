As for not wanting to listen to you, that too is normal.  I work in an elementary school and deal with this everyday.  They are very young and still learning respect. While on vacation, they have daddy all to themselves.  What kid doesn't like that?  If you were to join them, they'd have to share him with you.  Also at this age little girls are in love with daffy.  Many even get jealous of their own mothers. You sound like you're very loving, attentive, level headed and doing things right.  Give them time and try not to take all the things they do so personally.  Have your boyfriend and maybe their mother talk to them about showing respect and not hurting the feelings of others.  Good luck to you and keep up the good work.  ", 9497, "3ucrmVSpaa", 2],

Dad and you need to sit and talk about all the feelings and how Dad is going to teach them that your feelings and words are very important. When children start saying your not the boss type things. They know that you are but are waiting for the response from you, the dad and the mom.You need to be calm and clearly show them that you are the responsible adult. Dad needs to re enforce that. But he should be doing that whenever possible. Maybe not directly but by teaching and grooming the children. Nothing worst than to have dad go to children and say you need to listen, she is my girlfriend That's how she wants it. If I were you I would suggest counseling. Unfortunately people look at that as what I am not doing a good job? It's just good to get choices andd learn to say want you want properly.

Any kid would say \"you are not the boss of me\" if they are reprimanded by anyone other than a parent.   Kids go through phases like you described and all you can do is continue to have a close relationship with them and not try and act like a mother replacement.  If you push too hard it is when they will start saying things like that.  They may totally get the concept you are dad's girlfriend and will be around permanently and are just feeling jealous  and threatened and are acting out.  Give it time and things will settle down.  Believe me even the sweetest child has phases where they are little brats!  Get used to this if you are going to be their step mom one day and try not to take it too personally.  As for the pouting if you don't play with the one kid 24/7 my kids used to do the same thing so I am guessing that they most certainly are like this with their own mother too.  Don't start to believe they are perfect little angels with their mom and saving this negative behaviour for you.  ", 9497, "H41u0B8Jaa", 3],

I won't penalize them because of China's bad behavior. The problem started by the olympic committee years ago when they granted Beijing the 2008 Olympics. Because of their human rights policies, their non-existent animal rights, their suppression of the truth, their dangerous political views, as well as the dangerous environment (massive earthquakes, etc.) war with Tibet and Taiwan. All those things should have sent the olympics elsewhere. Now they are playing politics into the Olympic picture, which is supposed to fore go the atmosphere of political views. by pulling visas of awesome athletes  that by doing so, enhances their own chances of medals, as well as putting a political agenda on the floor. Anyone that doesn't agree with their policies are getting their visa's revoked.

Discuss with your partner when it is ok for you to interject while he's present. If he lets you take the lead while he's there instead of in his absence it will make an positive impact. eg Daddy can I go play? Why don't you go ask Bella if it's anything else she needs you to do.

They now have thier Daddy time and their Mommy time, and maybe feel as though you are invading that somehow and are acting out a bit. It was probably as though you were a friend at the beginning to them as well, and well they are seeing just how close of a friend you are to their Father and are reacting, you were lucky to have it go smooth at the beginning these situations are always so hard to get through, they aren't old enough to understand so they just may see you as the reason their parents aren't together and now that they've figured out you and him are more than friends, they are probably trying to understand .
