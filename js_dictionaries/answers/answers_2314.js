	121515 : ["How do the movements of the sun and the moon affect tide?  The gravitational pull of the moon tugs on the surface of the ocean until its surface mounds up and outward in the direction of the moon. When the mound of water has reached its highest point it is called high tide. On the opposite side of the earth from the moon, the centrifugal force caused by the earth's rotation produces another mound of water and high tide. Between these two high tides are two flat areas on the surface of the ocean which are the low tides. Each day there are two high tides and two low tides. The time between high and low tide is a little over 6 hours and the entire tidal cycle repeats itself four times each day. The regularity of the tides corresponds to the regular orbit of the moon around the earth and the rotation of the earth as it orbits around the sun.", 10665, "OQL0rcZuaa", 0],

	121530 : ["i'm so sorry, yet whoever instructed you that God kills human beings via fact of their kinfolk is defective. The God that actual Christians worship is loving and amazing. Fish for sure would not be attentive to what a real Christian is. i'm sorry approximately your son; that should have been very painful. i've got by no ability lost a baby, so i can purely think of what you went by. yet please, do not blame God. He loves human beings, and needs to be on the brink of them. Why could he desire to place them farther faraway from Him, with the help of taking toddlers? in case you're able to desire to communicate extra, i could be satisfied to communicate to you, basically e mail me. God knows the style you sense, regardless of if it could not look like it, and he easily did not punish you with the help of taking your son. in case you like to, i'm going to communicate to you later.

	121534 : ["Gravity! The gravitation pull between the moon and the earth causes a \"buldge\" of water on the side of the earth facing the moon and the side opposite. The buldge or build-up of water moves as the moon orbits the earth approximately once per day. This causes approximately two buldges (high tide / low tide) per day. By the way, the Sun's gravity also affects the tides causing the height of the tide to gradually change.", 10665, "None", 0],
	121535 : ["The answer is all about scale and the way gravity works.  The facts you need to know are these: 1  the distance between earth and the moon is on average about 238,000 miles 2  The radius of the earth os about 4,000 miles 3  The force of gravity varies inversely as the square of the distance between the two bodies concerned. At the average distance from the moon, the gravitational effect of the moon is - well, average.  But now think of the point on earth where the moon is directly overhead.  Draw the situation on a piece of paper.  The person for whom the moon is directly overhead is closer than average to the moon  -  by the earth's radius. Now think of someone on the opposite side of the earth.  For him or her, the moon isn't visible.  In fact it is directly under  his or her feet.  It is further away than average  -  by the earth's radius. Now consider the effects of all this on gravity.  At the point where the moon is overhead (the sublunar point, we call that), lunar gravity is proportional to 1/(238,000-4,000)^2 = 1/(234,000)^2 But at the other side of the earth, lunar gravity is proportional to 1/(238,000+4,000)^2 = 1/(242,000)^2 As you can see, these numbers are distinctly different.  In fact, it is quite surprising how different they are.  234 and 242 are about 3% different, so their squares are about 6% different.  THis is where we actually start to get to the answer to your question. At the sublunar point, lunar gravity is about 3% stronger than on average around the earth, and 6% stronger than at the point on the earth's surface opposite the sublunar point. Of course, the oceans can 'feel' this difference.  Because the lunar gravity is strong at the sublunar point, the oceans are particularly drawn towards the moon there.  In other words (since the moon is directly overhead), the oceans are drawn upwards  -  and the result is a high tide. Oddly enough, there is a high tide on the opposite side of the earth, too.  At the point opposite the sublunar point, the oceans are drawn towards the moon more weakly  -  but in this case, because the moon is directly underneath, the oceans are drawn DOWN weakly  -  and the result is a high tide again. Hope this helps you understand.", 10665, "Z9yUko3Yaa", 0],
