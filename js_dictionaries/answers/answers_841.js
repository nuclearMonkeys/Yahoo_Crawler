	46656 : ["¬† Carrots are not unsafe to eat regardless of the dietary following. The beta carotene in carrots in the human body, also isn't converted easily into retinol. In the human body the conversion has an at best conversion of twelve to one. However that's at the optimal conversion. However not everyone's body is that efficient in converting beta carotene into fully formed vitamin A. In fact there are people whose body is incapable of converting beta carotene, into the fully formed vitamin A. ¬† Some but not all vegans and even some of those who are vegetarian are aware of that, and they're also among those who realize that there's no such thing as a one size fits all diet. Now back on topic, vitamin A is the number five for people being either low or deficient in. So no no one should avoid carrots in general, unless they have what could be a rare allergy to them or root crops in general. Which to the best of my knowledge, the only base type of diet that would tell you to avoid carrots as well as all other root vegetables are those following some form of a paleo diet.", 6645, "MD1FznnXaa", 4],

What you need is antimins (remains of saints sewed into a towel, one cup, one spoon, wax candles, nonkosher non-yeast nonbarcoded nonqrcoded bread/wine, etc.) Electricity is from Satan; yeast is grown on pig bacteria, etc. Barcode = Druid black magic curse; QRcode = ancient Mayan curse... Kosher (K) or Union of Orthodox Synagogues (U) = sprinkled with blood like Mosis did. Underneath the entrance of synagogue lies New Testament...

Don't go into UFO to be ‚Äúhealed‚Äù by evil demons; demons never do good.
