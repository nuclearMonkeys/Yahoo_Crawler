	57131 : ["Nope. The only planets within anything like that distance is Venus and Mars, and even then it is only during close approaches. Both are not at all \"strange\" in the sense that they have been extensively explored using orbiters and landers. Within 20 billion miles? Nope. Unless there are a few rogue planets floating around, then there are no planets except those in our own solar system. Once again, all the planets in our solar system have been visited by spacecraft, so they are only strange in that more exploration is needed to tell us more about them. 20 trillion miles? Nope. Haven't even reached out to the nearest start in that distance. 200 trillion miles. A few stars are now included in that distance. Some of them are known to have planets. But there is no reason to suspect that any of those planets are in any way any stranger than Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, etc. All of which suggests that you need to read up on some astronomy textbooks, and get yourself a feel for the real scale of the universe.

	57137 : ["If those tests were taken on several different days at least one week after your period should have started, you can feel very confident in those negative results.  If you were pregnant, there would be enough hCG in your urine to give a positive result. If you didn't wait until you'd missed your period and or you took the tests one after the other on the same day, the results could be wrong. There isn't enough hCG in your blood, and therefore your urine, in the first couple of weeks after sex. hCG is also highest first thing in the morning. Testing after you've drunk a lot of liquid and used the bathroom a few times can cause the hCG to be diluted and not be concentrated enough to show a positive result. If your period is a week or more past due, you should see an ob/gyn.  They can do an exam and a blood test.  There are reasons other than pregnancy for a irregular cycle.  ", 7928, "RVK1NrNJaa", 0],
