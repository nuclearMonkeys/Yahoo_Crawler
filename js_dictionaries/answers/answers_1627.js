	87028 : ["Taurus With Cancer: compatibility  = 10 /10  Usually this makes the best of all love horoscope combinations. Cancer likes a good home with much affection, and so does Taurus. Deep inside this is what every Taurean hopes to find when undertaking conventional responsibilities (settling down). From an emotional point of view, there is nothing in the stars that bar the prospect of a happy married life between these zodiac sign match ups. One thing the Taurean must remember is that Cancer is exceedingly sensitive, and will crawl into a shell if unhappy emotionally. Taurus on the other hand, knows the Cancer's spirit and instinctively knows how to fix the problem once it arises. Cancer and Taurus were just plain born for each other. With this in mind woe is either one if this sun sign relationship does not work out! Just as the love between these two will be the stuff of legends, so will the conflict. The reason for this is that even in hate, there will still be love, and this will be very confusing for both of them, the confusion will translate to fear, and this will make the conflict brutal. Lesson here? If you are in this type of a relationship you should make every effort to avoid alienation.  Taurus With Scorpio: compatibility  = 7 /10  This astrological compatibility combination mutually admires each other. With a strong physical appetite, both will find much in common from a physical perspective. Jealousy however is the big problem with this pair and seems to be always showing its face. Taurus must be careful to keep faith with the scorpion mate, or the house will fall down without warning. Beware to the one whom crosses the scorpion's path; the sting is considered deadly. All else considered, friendship factor, financial drive, etc, makes them a very good match. These are zodiac opposites, but they are compatible earth and water signs. This usually manifests itself in a strong physical attraction at first. Both signs are intensely passionate, more so with Scorpio and both are the jealous and possessive types. Since they are opposites, they DO significantly attract and find themselves deeply in love when they go for it! This makes Taurus and Scorpio a great match.

Sagittarius is the wanderer and does not like to stop his/her choice on something certain. The Cancer wants to be sure of the love of the partner. The Sagittarius is not capable to ensure it. The Cancer lives for the sake of the future. Sagittarius lives for today. Cancer's jealousy is aroused by Sagittarius's flighty, faithless ways; Sagittarius is bored by Cancer's dependency. Sagittarius likes to wander, while Cancer is a stay-at-home. When Sagittarius feels boredom he/she begins searching for new connections/partners. The Cancer will be deeply offended by this fact. Sexually, Sagittarius is very active, and as a rule Cancer is easily satisfied. This can leave Sagittarius feeling let down and depressed and unfulfilled, which in turn will send him/her searching for a new partner.

This can leave Sagittarius feeling let down and depressed and unfulfilled, which in turn will send him/her searching for a new partner. There are vague prospects of more - less steady connection.   Cancer and Capricorn love compatibility  The Capricorn is not able to pay very much attention to the partner, and it doesn't meet the Cancer's wishes. The Capricorn has too much other interests. Both are good money managers and are unlikely to have many financial problems. Waste is an offense to Capricorn as is extravagance. Capricorn is a faithful and devoted mate which the more positive type of Cancer can be content with, even if life does get a little boring at times. However, there are a strong sexual attraction exists between these two signs. In a bedroom everything will be perfect, until Cancer feels bored with a practicality and restraint of the Capricorn. The connection is unstable, the marriage is undesirable.   Cancer and Aquarius love compatibility  Fun-loving Aquarius will be too unpredictable for a vulnerable Cancer. The Cancer is usually more open and steady than Aquarius who inclined to find new adventures. Aquarians love to share their life stories with the world while Cancer is satisfied to concentrate on personal obligations. Cancer have a conservative taste; Aquarius taste are usually the opposite. The Cancer's needs can't remain unsatisfied. Aquarius tends to exempt him/herself from the emotional requirements. They are able to find common language in bedroom for some time, though they will not sustain this partnership in a drawing room for a long time. The eccentricity of Uranus does not go well with the moods of Luna. Odds against this combination are too great for this combination, unless one will become subservient to the other.   Cancer and Pisces love compatibility  This is an affectionate, sensitive couple who will bolster each other's ego. Pisces is an imaginative dreamer but Cancer is an imaginative worker-and together they can make their dreams a reality. Pisces provides romance in Cancer's life, and Cancer is the all-protective lover Pisces needs. They are a good pair in the field of sex. They are both sympathetic and try to support each other. Probably the Cancer will be the leader, because of the the Pisces' inclination for some eccentricity in love affairs. The quarrels are usually short and quickly come to an end in bed. They are perfectly fit for each other. They can spend their time during day and during night with the same result and the sentimental combination of these two signs make for an ideal marriage.

	87041 : ["When these two meet, sparks may fly, but not necessarily the right kind. Sadge may come across as a player, casting a wide romantic net, which sets off alarms for the security-minded Crab. Cancer may intuit that it can trust Sadge, but be unsure of how deep their affections run. One innocent, but blunt comment from Sadge goes straight to the heart of an exposed Crab. The Archer has adventure in mind, and the sensitive Cancer may have trouble keeping up. Cancer needs to sidestep into things, while Sadge shoots forward like an arrow. If Cancer gets clingy, Sadge is likely to shoot right out the door. In a relationship, there's a built-in friction, given that Cancer desires domestic bliss and the Sagittarius spirit cannot be tamed. But with other harmonies in the charts, it could be a relationship full of growth. Cancer admires the vitality of fiery Sadge, and this inspires the moonchild to be more active. Sadge has a light nature, free of emotional underpinnings, while Cancer feels its way through things. The difference in orientation can be unsettling for both, and lead to misunderstandings galore. Cancer may think Sadge too superficial, and the Archer finds the heavy drama of the Crab to be a big drag. A creative living arrangement, like Frida and Diego's adjoining houses, give each the space they need. Cancer needs time to process and be still, and Sadge is a lone adventurer at heart. Sadge models a way of living free of emotional moodiness, and helps Cancer see beyond their own world. Cancer can be a nourishing presence to Sadge, offering a home base to return to between travels. This is a quirky pairing that pushes each other's buttons, but with the potential to experience life in a totally different way. Famous Couples: Frida Kahlo (Cancer) and Diego Rivera (Sagittarius); Tom Cruise (Cancer) and Katie Holmes (Sagittarius); Jean Cocteau (Cancer) and Jean Marais (Sagittarius); Ellen Burstyn (Sagittarius) and Neil Burstyn (Cancer); Mike Tyson (Cancer) and Robyn Givens (Sagittarius); Edith Piaf (Sagittarius) and Marcel Cerdan (Cancer)", 9251, "eRPvMWsFaa", -2],

Taurus may work well with Cancer woman because he can appreciate her sense of humor and good nature...but she may drive him nuts because she can be a bit of a whiner and somewhat of a complainer...but all in all Taurus does well with Water signs, so if you work hard to make it work then it will work (but my advice::: watch out for Scorpios ways...)", 9250, "8fa8cf54bfb0accd35e867a88686563daa", 0],

The warmth and caring nature of Cancer feel regenerating to Scorpio, and Scorpio sense of an all-encompassing love appeals to you Cancer deeply. Both have the similar ways of expressing their love and make each other feel “at home”. A Scorpio man is an invincible person. He is an extremist with calm and steady surface and smoldering passion within him. Beneath the soft voice of Scorpio male lays his subtle strategies to enhance his career and personal life. He is one person who loves luxury and comforts immensely. He can sink into depression, or rise to intoxicating heights of ecstasy. In love with a Cancer woman, he is a passionate lover who knows all the synonyms of romance and eroticism. Though he is a great lover, but together with it he is very jealous and suspicious in nature too. He can be passionate just about anything, including sex, love and family. If you look at the surface, he will look totally calm and composed. Just look beneath that outer layer of his and you will find his smoldering passion. A Cancer woman is enigmatically feminine. She is a gentle and kind lady with a good sense of humor and capturing aura of delicate personality. Her feelings are sensitive and tender and her loyalty is spotless. Though, she may not look very strong, but she is a tower of strength for her dear ones and perfectly able to manage herself, if alone. Patience is her dearest virtue and flexibility is her biggest weapon to win in all circumstances. Being in love with a Scorpio man, stirs the deepest emotions of the Cancer female making her a perfect match for a passionate male like him. Cancer woman is always an interesting lady for a Scorpio man. She is full of such feminine mysteries which a curious Scorpio man always wants to unfold completely but gently. She has a reserved outlook in the beginning which attracts him but soon she shows him her great sense of humor which makes even a serious person like him to smile. She brings colors and joys to his life and provides him with a companion who is always by his side to love, care and understands his feelings. She is actually one person who understands him well deep to his soul and knows what goes on under his cool and composed surface. Loyalty is the biggest trait that makes him feel comfortable with a Cancer woman. Though to his dislike, he can find her to be possessive and bossy at times and also has to tolerate her mood swings but with such love and loyalty in return, he understands her value and keeps a cool temper while dealing with her mood swings.", 9250, "None", 0],

Given the fact that the universe began to exist, it must have had a “cause” that originated it.Doesn't it make more sense to assume the existence of a Creation. The question is tricky because it sneaks in the false assumption that GOD came from somewhere and then asks where that might be. The answer is that the question does not even make sense. It is like asking, “What does blue smell like?” Blue is not in the category of things that have a smell, so the question itself is flawed. In the same way, GOD is not in the category of things that are created or caused. GOD is uncaused and uncreated—He simply exists. We know that from nothing, nothing comes. So, if there were ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence, then nothing would have ever come into existence. But things do exist. Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been in existence. That ever-existing being is what we call GOD ,GOD is the un-caused Being that caused everything else to come into existence. God is the uncreated Creator who created the universe and everything in it. The universe requires a cause because it had a beginning, GOD unlike the universe, had no beginning, so he doesn't need a cause. Einstein's theory of general relativity, which has much experimental support, shows that time is linked to matter and space. So time itself would have begun along with matter and space.
