	46155 : ["It depends on the game & how the game is coded to deal with it. The possible results are... 1) You're completely blocked by an invisible wall, preventing you from going out of bounds completely. 2) You get a warning & a few seconds to turn back before the game kills automatically kills you, forcing you back into the game's map. 3) Just outright kill you without warning (as you know what you're doing is against the game's code). 4) Generally nothing but boring, empty space before triggering an error that resets your position on the map. -- This is generally caused by either bad programming OR some type of exploit that allows players to bypass the boundaries. In the online game FreeRealms (now discontinued), a couple of players & myself did find a way to get over an in-world boundary (which was fairly tricky to pull off) & did a little exploration in this \"out of bounds\" section, which was just a completely flat area, before reaching the physical edge of the world & jumping off (resetting your position back in-bounds).  We didn't get in trouble with the admins, but this was during their open beta phase (so they were testing stuff out) & we kept this secret to ourselves (& rarely showed others this fairly innocuous exploit). Many Battle Royale games, the game has an enforced boundary that will periodically shrink as a game mechanic.  Going outside the in-game boundary will result in receiving ongoing damage (which increases as the match progresses) until you're dead OR return to the game's boundaries.  With such a mechanic, it's virtually impossible to break the bounds of the game map as the game mechanics will kill you before you hit such limits. Just be careful if you're seriously planning on doing this as it can be consider cheating or hacking, which could get you banned...  so proceed at your own risk.", 6591, "5d801299a74e13682dc0885d3c2692a7aa", 0],

	46182 : ["So you're addicted. It is and isn't your fault. They load fast food with tasty sugars and preservatives to keep you coming back for more. Fast food has been shown to be highly addictive, like a drug, and you throw in fast food being SUPER convenient, POOF! you have the perfect storm of them making money and you being a sucker. Sorry if that comes off as rude, but I'm being honest. HOWEVER, only you can change if you're willing to put in the work you say you are. Nothing homemade will ever taste like fast food, ever. It's missing all the nasty, artificial crap that makes it so tasty. If you make a homemade hamburger with fresh cut potatoes and use those to make french fries, you will take a bite, put it down, then mope because \"it's not the same thing.\" Well of course it isn't, so you're setting yourself up for failure right then and there. That's your biggest issue, along with the addiction. It's not fast food, so get that through your head. It's never going to be fast food. Fast food also doesn't fill you up as much as you claim it does. It's meant to be HUGE PORTIONS, FULL OF CRAP, and nothing nutritionally sound about it, which in turn, makes you want it MORE. There is no EASY way to stop it. You have to cut it out completely. Like any addiction, you will be craving it, cranky, irritable, headaches and possibly the sweats because your body is so used to it. This may take a week for the physical cravings to go away, a lot longer for the mental cravings to go away. You should also learn how to cook, in EARNEST, real, fresh, healthy foods that are good for you and are within your budget. Try different things. Don't limit yourself. Try everything you can. There is so much good, nutritious food out there for you to eat and cook, so much better than fast food. Again, by you trying different things yourself and already saying that it won't be the same will set you up for failure again and again. DUH. So you need filling and sound foods. Wheat toast with eggs and avocados. Popcorn for snacks. Sandwiches packed with veggies for lunch. Salmon and veggies for dinner. You are too all about convenience and convincing yourself this is the only way to eat. You need to make TIME for yourself and your health. There is no easy way to do this, until you bite the bullet and DO IT, and THEN it will become easier. I haven't had fast food in months. I can't remember the last time I had it, actually. It's not impossible, so stop telling yourself that is it. You just have to make time to cook and invest in your health. ", 6574, "0V875zvYaa", 2],
