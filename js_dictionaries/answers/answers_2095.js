	110528 : ["Your hypothesis is perhaps a bit simplistic. Can I just give my area \" Reading\"  in the eighties and nineties as an example. Reading consistently had  two Conservative MPs. But Reading Borough Council was always a Labour controlled Council, BUT this had not come about because most people had voted a different way in local elections from which Party they voted for in national elections, but from the ways constituency boundaries vary. You see, put simply in the centre of any town you will get much more left wing (or if you like \"working class\") people), whereas if you go out of town into the area covered by Rural District Councils with much bigger and more expensive homes in the main than in the town centre, most people tend to be predominantly right wing or middle to upper class, who regard the working class Brits as lazy smelly thickies who needed to be kept under the boot..  So in that scenario, there was never any kind of partnership between the town's MPs and the town's Councillors in the eighties and nineties But in 1998 because the Conservatives had become so unpopular all over the UK after the fall of John Major's terrible government, many former Conservative chappies living in big houses so liked Tony Blair that both Reading's parliamentary seats swung to Labour. But during subsequent years the Borough Council continued to be Labour controlled. Yet there was still no partnership between local and national government in that situation either, they were just as much at loggerheads. Today in Reading we have one Labour MP and one Tory MP. But the Borough Council is still Labour controlled. butd I still detect no sign of any co-operation between the two Authorities. They are still at loggerheads..  But I personally think democracy was much better represented in the days before the fifties when in local elections  all the Candidates stood effectively as \"Independents\", and people voted on the basis of the Election Addresses of candidates  which the voter choosing the person he or she believed indicated the local government policies they most approved of, not on whether he had a \"C\" or a \"Lab \"after his or her name.", 10145, "s5G91umgaa", 0],

	110530 : ["Yeah... Obama created the Patriot Employer Act... but supported the liberty and democracy-destroying USA Patriot Act! Just like Hillary Clinton did. Ask all the ordinary people who've been wiretapped, arrested, and spied on for no good reason since THAT day. They both flip-flop on everything... you get the hot air on war in the Middle East, while all the while BOTH of them really want war in Iran. Obama's spoken in support of it! And Clinton's VOTED for it! (Obama didn't bother to show up of coure) You get the hot air on campaign finance reform, while BOTH of them take in more and more money from big companies, including private HEALTH INSURANCE companies... and the hot air against lobbyists, while they EMPLOY lobbyists in their campaigns! I'm sick of seeing these two talk the talk while doing the exact opposite when it really matters. But never getting confronted about it. EXCEPT by Senator Mike Gravel. Plus there's a big difference between access to health care INSURANCE, and access to REAL healthcare. REAL healthcare funded properly, like the policy advocated by Gravel- the one who made all the right points in debate, slayed both Obama and Clinton when he got up to speak, and rightly so, then got kicked out of the debates after Clinton plotted with John Edwards to make that happen. The guy who REALLY opposes war in the Middle East and doesn't just flip-flop. The one who's been running honestly and not just PRETENDING to stand against the lobbyists and big business, like Obama is. Gravel's the only one who REALLY opposes 'big-money' politics. Gravel's the one who's got the real 'experience' and the real track record in the Senate too... for starters, ending the military draft in America virtually singlehanded by filibustering alone for 5 months. And personally forcing out the truth about government lies over the Vietnam War, risking jail in the process. And plenty of other achievements besides. (   )I could live my whole life twice over and NEVER see this kind of courage from Obama OR Clinton. I wonder when we'll ever see someone in a position to win the Presidential race who supports REAL change, not just empty catchphrases and slogans... but we've all got to vote to make it happen of course... I know I don't want to see another anti-immigration candidate who supports building a wall on the US border. Like Obama AND Clinton both seem to want. What do they want, to make the US the next East Germany? LOL", 10139, "fJOT4RIYaa", -1],

Voting in an election isn't like supporting a football team, you have to pick who you think will do the best job on each occasion, especially in the case of the local councillor, whose actions and input will have a much more direct and immediate impact on your life.

	110547 : ["Not at all.  Local policies are not the same as national policies and it might be that one party has better policies for the local area, while another has better national policies.  People don't seem to see that though and use local elections as a popularity poll on Westminster.  It doesn't help that the media and politicians themselves actively encourage that view. Regardless of how people vote, it often happens in London, where the density of the population means a borough can have more than one MP - the borough I live in has three, and with the boundary changes, my constituency is going to include part of the next borough at this year's election.  2 of the seats are Conservative, the remaining one being Labour, with the result that the council is almost always Conservative.  Another adjacent borough has one traditionally Conservative seat (which went Labour when with the last boundary changes, it took on some of the adjoining borough), one Labour seat, and a third that is one of the country's leading marginals and usually changes sides with every change of government, so the council tends to flip back and forth quite frequently.
