Definitivamente una excelente adaptación de las novelas. - Ano hi Mita Hana, al principio como que la historia se narra sin que uno sepa que es lo que está pasando, pero poco a poco a través de un excelente guión, a mi parecer, se desvela toda la situación, poniendo justo en medio los sentimientos de cada uno de los personajes, y de verdad llega, ese realismo del desenvolvimiento, te llega. Y quizá fue por ello que fue con Ano Hana que lloré más que con ninguna otra serie >//< , como dices, difícilmente otra serie pueda superar series como ésta. Waa, me hiciste revivir todas esas pequeñas pero significantes emociones que estaban guardados en mi corazoncito xD. Pero como viste lo que a una serie la hace, son unos definidos personajes, y las emociones que ésta te haga sentir. Si tiene todo eso, entonces difícilmente se borrará de nuestras memorias.
