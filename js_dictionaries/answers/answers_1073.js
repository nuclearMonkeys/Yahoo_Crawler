	59170 : ["\"What are some examples of systematic or institutional sexism in the U.S.?\" Systematic or Institutionalized sexism, otherwise known as legal discrimination, or state sanctioned discrimination, only occurs against men today in the US (and pretty much all Western nations). In the US, we have the selective service military obligation where all men must register or face legal restrictions on their Rights and benefits. Women are exempt from this entirely. Men also face affirmative action whereas women do not. There are many taxpayer funded \"women's only\" programs that are denied to men just because they are men. There is also restrictive wording against access for men in VAWA and Title IX. This is just a quick list. Institutionalized sexism against women was dealt with pretty much entirely by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Only the spotty toplesness laws that vary by state can be considered legal discrimination against women. For actual equality, it is time to give men the same protections against systemic sexism here as is afforded women. Equal Rights AND equal Responsibilities should be the mantra now. .", 8214, "aSm9xSn3aa", 7],
