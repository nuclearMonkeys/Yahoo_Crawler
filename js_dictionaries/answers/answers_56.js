Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is UTC-04.00. However, when ET is on EDT the UK is probably going to be on British Summer Time (BST), which is UTC+01.00.

	2809 : ["I would say that it is rude, unless you are gay yourself, and a close friendship at work looks like heading towards romance, when you might want to get things sorted before either of you goes too far in making assumptions. That does not seem to be the case with your work colleagues.  In a workplace of a dozen colleagues, male and female, I did not know that one of them was gay for the first 6 or so years I worked there.  It did not occur to me to ask any of my colleagues about their sexual orientation. I came to know that some of them were married, as I was. End of story. Note that I am British. We tend to be less 'forward' about personal matters than some Americans are.", 448, "None", 0],

	2832 : ["There are a whole host of reasons why the population of these countries are very different. As others have pointed out there is topography to consider. Then there is climate.

Indeed the 'Vikings' came from those parts. The word 'viking' means 'a wandering person' - the younger generations had to move out and 'wander around' seeking, sometimes violently, places to live because there was not enough land in the steep valleys (fjords) to feed large communities.  In fact, some of those Vikings settled in the British Isles and in France. Many place names in  the British Isles are from Norse (Viking) sources. Most Norwegians and Swedes I have met have been friendly people.", 459, "None", 1],
