Your science teacher is right...it would take generations to reach Earth from another star.  It has, however, been speculated that during various periods throughout the earth's history, we may have been invaded/visited by DNA-like molecules capable of reproduction, but this may or may not be considered extraterrestrial life. The next time you hear about an alien abduction, watch their faces closely: 1 in three either can't keep a straight face or will exhibit body signs of lying.  The other two who appear to be telling the truth may have been hallucinating and/or more often than not, were victims of child abuse.

	129344 : ["The reality is that a small portion of the population has made changes not always popular with the majority. I don't think most of us would argue that point. I don't think, as an example, that most Americans want cancer from polluted air and waterways. But it is happening too often with the support of the government and courts. But the specific issue you mention is Christians vs. Atheists influence. Personally, I don't think it is either. I think that a way of life in America is passing. Whether for better or worse is the subject of another debate. For many who favor that way of life it is attributed as a moral decline. As an example, when I was in high school, young ladies were required to wear dresses to school. Now they can wear shorts and other varieties of clothing. For those who believe that a dress standard is important this is an example of moral change. To the person who doesn't want to wear dresses, this is a sign of progress. As for religion, America has always until modern times lived under Christian Influence. We can argue whether or not the government was formed in this way. As a nation influenced by Christianity, certain values were present. You can see those values in the government. The Ten Commandments is one of these. As the nation grew in recent years and larger numbers of atheists, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and others have become an influence on American Culture there has been a push to change traditional ways. As an example, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Ten Commandments can not be displayed in courts. For Christians who have always valued such displays, this is seen as moral decline. For others it is viewed as freedom from Christian oppression. As for the control issue, a small minority can make major changes. Need I remind this group that the liberals and conservatives are very concerned about the next Supreme Court Justice and control of the Supreme Court? That decision is rarely determined by the public interest. The elections we suffer through now are financed by major corporations and individuals on BOTH sides. It is these organizations that determine who sits in leadership of our nation. Read John Grisham's latest book as he looks at this influence. Pastor John", 11028, "None", 1],

	129347 : ["I do not understand how people can deny that proof right in front of their faces.  There are mountains of evidence showing the existence of extraterrestrial visitation.  The trouble with your science teacher is that he's talking about science is 20 to 30 years out of date.  Maybe he should study upon the new stuff.  We already have the theoretical knowledge to build a faster than light drive.  We don't have the technology yet but we may have soon.  As for the comment about only ignorant people believing in aliens visiting the earth, that is the most ignorant remark ever made.  Dr. J Allen Hynek was a world class astronomer and consultant to Project Blue Book.  For your those those of you who don't know PBB was the Air Force investigation into UFOs.  Dr. Hynek wrote two books about the results of the investigation and his conclusions as to the authenticity of the UFO visitation.  He was firmly convinced that many of the reports are absolutely correct.  His credentials are above reproach.  Dr. James Mcdonald, a physicist, was a firm believer in the extraterrestrial nature of the UFOs.  These two gentlemen were considered tops in their fields.  I don't see how anyone could call them ignorant or uneducated.  General Nathan Twining wrote a letter to the president stating that the UFO phenomenon was absolutely real.  If he had been  a crackpot, he would not have remained in his position.  I do not understand how anyone here thinks they are better educated, more intelligent, or more qualified than these people are.  As for traveling faster than light, E=mc2 does not prove it is impossible.  Albert Einstein himself did not deny the possibility of faster than like travel.  People in here just state their own myopic, helio centric opinions without any evidence to back it up.  So, in conclusion, the evidence supports the idea of extraterrestrial visitation no matter what anyone tries to say.", 11021, "PZM40PLxaa", 0],

Regardless of the size of government, big business can  control government policy (by bribing politicians). That is, indeed, how it works in case you were unaware. But what does that mean? Big business (such as big oil companies) convince [bribe] government to  give big businesses tax subsidies.  Do you know what that is?  It is government money which could have gone into many things like:  road repair,  traffic light repair,  pothole repair,  better healthcare for seniors,  better police response time,  better fire dept response time, etc. But guess what; you're not getting these services as well as they could have  been provided to you.  You know why? Because government says it doesn't have the money to fund these services. Well government would have had that money if it weren't funneling it into the  pockets of big business! --- Big business doesn't just want your money.

	129359 : ["That, sir, is an excellent point. Every poll that has ever been conducted, concerning this country's religious affiliation, overwhelming demonstrates that most people do identify themselves with some sort of Christian faith, and yet Christians are the ones that harp on the most about our moral degradation. So it would seem to make sense that Christians should lay the blame squarely on their own shoulders. Unfortunately most Christians don't abide by their Jesus' admonishment to: “ Not look at the speck in your brothers eye, without first removing the beam in your own”.  Of course many Christians will say that the polls only express those who “PROFESS” faith, but not TRUE believers. Still, this does not absolve Christians of their responsibility for the moral decline they claim is occurring with ever increasing rapidity.  After all, Christianity has had the power of the government behind it, and has been the largest influence on the global culture, for the past 2000 years.  So if Christianity cannot even convert enough “true believers” to change the world for the better it demonstrates that Christianity is ineffectual and a failure. Moreover, it underscores the fact that if there is a God, and Christianity is the religion he approves us, then he is also impotent, because he cannot inspire enough people to TRULY believe and become catalysts for change.  Many right wing Christians relish the fact that Communism failed, and cite it (erroneously I might add) as evidence of what happens when you exclude God from national culture and government. So why don't they apply that same logic and also condemn their own religion as a failure, because it, being given 1900 more years to work than “Godless” Communism,  has not vanquished poverty, eliminated disease, or made people any more moral. Christians refuse to look at themselves in the mirror. Christians refuse to take the proverbial beam out of their own eye. They would much rather put on the blindfold of self-righteousness.", 11028, "2a83d387aec1bc6928d92060e8ac8eaeaa", -1],

	129365 : ["The only people that think that some sort of alien life form has 'visited' earth are the uneducated, naive and extremely closed minded. Yes that's right the people that believe in things are closed minded ones.  A very simple way to explain it is in the fact the many people lack any clear understanding of how big space actually is!  Think of it this way, the next nearest star is a star called Proxima Centuri. It lays at around 4 light-years from our sun, Sol. Do you have any idea how far just one light-year actually is?  A light year is a measure of distance (Not time as many confuse it with) which is 9,460,730,472,580.8 km or just under 10 trillion kilometers! That is a long way in anyone's language. Now Proxima Centuri is 4 times that distance! And that is the nearest star outside ours. Now the next nearest extra-solar planet is some 20 light-years away! 20 light-years! This extra solar planet is not even terrestrial, it is a gas giant like Jupiter but much bigger! The next nearest terrestrial planet is at least 50 light-years...that is 50 x 10 trillion kilometers!  The next problem is this, nothing of mass can travel at light-speed! That's right, if you have mass of any kind the laws of physics forbid attaining this speed. This is because of the oft repeated equation of special relativity E=MC2. Do you understand what that is about? Most people have no idea whatsoever, but try and deny its existence. It is a conversion formula! To better demonstrate this, go to this site and read the information here:  This is why your science teacher knows that aliens have not been here because he understands this equation.  As for there actually being life somewhere in our Galaxy (not the entire universe) other than just on Earth, we have yet another equation. it is called the Drake equation:  N = N* fp ne fl fi fc fL Now it can be argued that is flawed due the number of unknowns, but that is why it can also be applied, because it is speculating on an unknown quantity.  Here is an explanation:    And here is why it is so difficult to use this equation:  Hope this helps. It is a very simplistic explanation, but I hope you understand that your teacher is not just giving lip service about this, your teacher probably knows these things outlined and has formed the conclusions based on those facts.
