I have an attachment of earnings order and they just seem to take what they like despite being a one income family with a new baby. Anyway the answer is this - yes they can quite legally go back that length of time in order to claim arrears. Unbelievably they can also take 40% of his take home pay to clear the arrears, and there is not a damned thing he can do about it. The only thing he can do is challange the amount of arrears and see if it ties in with his earnings over the last 5 years. They were screwing me for £2200 arrears - when I challanged them they said I owed  £1800, then £1560 and eventually admitted I owed £1100 - a big difference from the original figure. So challange them, then challange them again and again. The CSA are not there for the children. They are target driven bullies using despiciple methods to exctract unrealistic amounts of money from men who generally speaking are caring, loving and hands on Fathers. If they applied as much effort into traking down Dads who refuse to pay instead of screwing you and me the country would be a better place.", 10386, "39289dc405e463c39def3981cfcb6a2faa", 2],

They listen to his ex wife and she lies and was caught lying in the tribunal but that hasn't made any difference.  If they do take his licence, he will lose his job and wont be able to pay so its so stupid.  Good luck.  Oh, there is a website but I can' t remember the name of it.

Ex: Boogey man, Duece and Domino (man they suck), MVP (*barfs*), Umaga (y did he get a WM match?) etc So until WWE is able to develop or create superstars how they used to before, I suggest that WWE needs to change its direction before even deciding if they need another supernatural guy.", 10385, "None", 0],

First find your documents from the past as previous posts have said and go from there and if that fails call your state senators on this one and speak with them & write them a letter addressing this issue too.

I worked full time and he stopped working lucky me...and said support was set for $275 a month for three children our oldest lived with him,my family thinks I am a under paid child person for my children with the child support that comes in oh well...to me it's only money...kids need things and that is what happens kids need stuff. Stuff costs. Also my ex  is now married to a wonderful at times lady other times well I won't write my opinon...any how life happens... Our fourth child is thirteen and they're riding him to move there my child told a counseler he believes it's all about child support payments and that and to babysit her two kids an the newest child they had. He was there for a visit and cared for a child under the age of one the whole week of his said visit while his dads wife left town to do stuff.Not cool,jmo. Sorry to ramble well child support sent me $150 extra I called them to see why and they said ;\"use it.\" I called another place they said the same thing. Next thing U know they screwed up and sent me someone else's support and needed it back really quick like. So folks are human they make mistakes... Any ways keep record and document phone calls ect...and see what happens and also with your documents photo copy and contact your state Rep and Senators too and have them inquire too.

You should also gather any evidence of any other types of maintenance or payments he may have made independently to his children and copies of any letters you have sent them. When you call them log the date and time of the call and get the name of wheoever it is that you speak to, keep it in a notebook. Make sure you keep written records of it all.

Citizens advice are free, not just your first appointment...but all the services they offer are free. They are very helpful when it comes to CSA problems, they know their stuff.

Odds are your relationship ended on a heated note. I don't know why you and your ex broke up, but there was probably at least one (if not a few dozen) big fights. Done properly (the way I'm going to teach you), texting is simple and subtle.
