	139049 : ["For the most part, I agree.  Mostly because gimmicks are made-up characters that have to fit in with the times and with what the audience expects.  Wrestlers that don't have gimmicks, if they are charismatic enough, can get over anywhere any time. Andre didn't have a gimmick (until very late in his career when he turned heel on Hogan).  But his incredible charisma and magnetism, and his friendly attitude, made him a natural attraction.  A real living breathing giant who could move well, could actually wrestle, and had a great attitude.  People all over the world loved Andre.  He wasn't called \"the eighth wonder of the world\" just because he was tall.  Andre was incredibly popular everywhere he wrestled; before \"Hulkamania\" Andre was the most popular wrestler in the world.  A young Andre debuting in the WWE today (as he did decades ago in another company) would get over immediately.  But the WWE wouldn't let him be just Andre, they'd stick some stupid gimmick on him that might or might not work out.  Andre didn't NEED a gimmick.  The 15-year undefeated streak wouldn't work in the WWE today because Vince killed what made giants special.  Big Show and Khali should never lose because of their size.  But it's because of their size that Vince has them lose.  Beating a giant makes whichever flavor of the month Vince wants to push look stronger.  Khali is not even a pimple on Andre's butt.  Big Show is a helluva lot better than Khali but he's no Andre The Giant, I guaran-damn-tee that!  If you'd seen Andre in his prime, you would understand.  Andre was a once-in-a-lifetime performer who is irreplaceable.  Andre would get over anywhere any time and be the biggest star in the company. The superman \"Hulk Hogan\" gimmick only worked in the 80's, and only in the WWF.  Vince was pushing cartoon characters in his live-action cartoon shows and Hogan was the Hero in the whole thing.  That same gimmick wore out it's welcome after several years in the WWF and flopped when Hogan tried it in WCW in the mid 90's.  Hogan HAD to change his gimmick and turn heel or the fans would have just stopped watching. I think the Ultimate Warrior would get over with today's WWE fans.  Yeah he's a cartoon character but that gonzo crazed barbarian was entertaining as hell!  The only tweak to the gimmick that would be needed is to make his promos actually mean something rather than those bizarre promos he did back then.  He would be as successful, maybe more so, as Batista was.  He would be more popular than Batista ever was.  The Ultimate Warrior was entertaining and fun to watch. The WWE has taught it's fans to accept only charismatic actors/public speakers in ridiculous gimmicks as WWE main eventers/World Champs.  Bret is not one of those.  Yeah, he'd be another \"Benoit\" or \"Shelton\". The Undertaker gimmick...hard to say.  Yeah, a cartoon supernatural character, and those don't work anymore.  But Mark Calaway is not your ordinary run of the mill \"sports entertainer\".  If he wasn't so talented, so believable, so charismatic, the Undertaker gimmick would not have succeeded like it has.  If anybody could pull off that type of character and make it work, it's Mark Calaway. BQ:  Not all of them.  Andre could get over anywhere any time; he didn't have or need a gimmick.  The Ultimate Warrior I think could work today provided they change his ridiculous promos. BQ2:  Strike Force (Tito  na and Rick Martel), goody two-shoes pretty boy babyface tag team.  That worked in the 80's; it doesn't work today.  Speaking of Martel, that \"Model\" gimmick of his wouldn't work today.  Self-absorbed narcissist.  Fans would just call him \"gay\" (as in homosexual).  \"Meat\" (Shawn Stasiak), sexual plaything for Terri Runnels and Miss Jacqueline.  Accepted in the Attitude Era but wouldn't even get laughs today.  The Headbangers.  A couple of thrash metalheads.  Thrash metal has gone out of style and those who made that type of music were only accepted by the fans of that type of music.  Even the Attitude Era fans didn't care much for them.  \"Goldust\" would flop if he debuted today.  He's only accepted today because he's been in the WWE a long time and is not the same character he was when he debuted. BQ3:  Andre The Giant, Triple H, The Hardy Boyz (the tag team, not Jeff and/or Matt as singles wrestlers), Sheamus, The Road Warriors (or Legion Of Doom as the WWE calls them), The Undertaker, Kane, \"Latino Heat\" Eddie Guerrero, Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, the Ultimate Warrior, Batista, \"The Heartbreak Kid\" Shawn Michaels.", 11409, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", 4],

	139069 : ["Absolutely. Blame it on the internet and modern technology. LOL. We get too much information and people are so afraid of looking like idiots  if they follow it. I can imagine all of those failing today, except the Bret Hart one. Like the Undertaker. The dead man gimmick was great because we knew nothing back then about Mark Calaway. Me knowing he loved animals, was like, AW, he isn't such a bad guy. And I found that out on the internet. But no one was gonna believe he was dead. Back then, people would had believed it, because WCW didn't out the  entire franchise by saying it was all fake. If you ask me, No one takes the Undertaker's gimmick seriously anymore, and any admiration for him now is out of shear respect and nothing more.  Cena falls victim to Hogan's gimmick as the icon of the WWE. But now, people hate on him because Cena is so cheesy and lame. People need to remember wrestling back then, was cheesy and lame, and even that didn't stop them. Hogan was cheesy and lame, but it was the most successful gimmick ever. It got fans going wild all over the world.  And in the PG era, the monster era is just dead. Khali went soft the second WWE went PG, along with Kane, Mark Henry, and even the Undertaker. Now the giant gimmick, is a shame too. Because its still great, but now that we know that its common, we don't care for it as much, which is sad. Now what was great about Big Show and Andre the Giant was that they can wrestle. If you bring in a giant that can actually wrestle, unlike Khali, I think it has potential.  Now, I say Bret Hart might be okay, because its a techinical cocky gimmick. To me, that is more real, which seems key these days in gimmicks. The average athlete running their mouth in the ring, getting whats coming to them and stuff. You take a gimmick like that to the internet and realize, woah, this guys are cooler in real life then on tv, while if you had guys like Kane, who is smart and political, and you think, why is he a monster again? The idea with gimmicks these days seem to be that it has to be more realistic, because its \"what the fans want?\" Which is a joke. I blame the attitude era. True, guys like the Rock and Stone Cold took \"realistic\" and made it larger then life, but it was because the stuff they said and did on tv that isn't restricted by the PG 13 like these days. They were able to do that. But back then, colorful and stereotypical gimmicks were ideal, in the creation of like Mankind, Macho Man Randy Savage, and Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat. These days, its gonna be \"retarded, gay, and racist.\" But they were so entertaining and unreal back then.  So I think base on how educated and opinionated fans are these days, those gimmicks won't work. We just wouldn't accept it as easily as fans back then. Look at HBK. If he was a new guy, people would had called the gimmick gay \"Sexy Boy\" and stupid (mullet and heart patterns on his pants). And look at the corny @ss jokes he did in the new DX. But we will always accept him through shear respect. And just that. No one talks about his gimmick anymore, and its the same with Taker. Gimmicks have become obsolete these days. BQ: I answered most of them. BQ2: Goldust perverted ones, thats for sure. LOL. Anything offensive, really, like african tribal men, asian martial artists, gay and bi men like Rico. The Eugene gimmick. The Monster gimmick, look at Brodus Clay.  Blame the fact WWE wants to be sponsored by the very groups that ruin their product, by stating they can't be racist, scary, sexist, or have people bullying others by name calling. So far, business men, punks, heros, and jocks, are the ideal gimmick theses days. BQ3: Attitude era and before that. No internet so no smart @ss goes on and ruins it for others, and Corny wasn't so horrible, and people didn't care so much if WWE was giving a \"bad\" impression.", 11409, "jMziHr7Iaa", 0],

	139074 : ["I must admit, you've got good card-making skills. This a superb card. Batista- Lesnar is a skilled fighter, it'll be a close won. I hate Lesnar but that's not why I put him over. It's because he has a lot of mouth, and when he battled in UFC, he lost. But I must say, this one would be extremely close. I can see the finish as Batista is now getting up and Lesnar runs at him then.... Batista pins Lesnar after a Spinebuster on a running Lesnar. Angle- I like Bret more, but Angle is a top-notch wrestler. He is a Brawler, Technical, Submission, and on rare occasions- Powerhouse, Hardcore. He is no High Flyer, though. Bret's good too. This, like the first, will be close and definitley will not be a squash. But I can see Angle dominating in most of the match, but that doesn't mean it's a squash. I can see a lot of Ankle Locks and Sharpshooters being used. I can even see Angle reversing a Shooter into a Ankle Lock! Bret taps after a Angle Slam then an Ankle Lock. Cena- ot much to say. Hogan's gotten too old. The greatest match ever vs. Andre that he had was the most set-up match in WWE. All of them are, but that was the most fake if you know what I mean. In the others, the wrestles really get hurt. In Hogan's match, he just didn't get no pain, even when Andre accidentally dropped on him. Cena's best matches- he puts his body on the line. I am not a Cena Maniac, I like Hogan better than Cena. But I still say Cena would win, I respect both men. By the way, I think this'll be the closest match on the card, even if I said Hogan's best match was totally setup, I still think that he has awesome wrestling skills. Very Close. I would prefer Cena to win by STFU, it's unpredictable but unfortunately I think that.... Cena pins Hogan after a long, brutal match via FU. Scratch what I said above. THIS MATCH IS GOING TO BE THE CLOSEST, AND THE BEST ONE ON THE CARD!!!!!!! I can see big pops, loads of good moves (including finishers but not limited to), and a very close win for both men! No contest- This will be longer than Cena-Hogan Match, and both men will hit a move on each other at the same time(finishers or something else) and get a double KO. Warrior- Good match, but I think warrior would win for sure, DQ or BNo DQ. It doesn't matter. Both men will get huge pops, especially Warrior. But I think It'll not be even half as good as the other matches. Not even Half! Warrior pins Foley after a Super Spinning Heel Kick driving a chair into Foley's face. No matter if Vince is involved or not, this would be as equally as good as the Rock-Michaels match. I can imagine these two men in a fight even if Vince didn't send HHH after Savage. This will have very big pops and will have the equal intensity and outcomes with The Rock -Michaels match. No Contest- Exactly the same thing as HBK-Rock match. 10/10 card.", 11409, "AA10624250", -1],
