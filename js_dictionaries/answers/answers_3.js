When you put in new oil it is clear like honey. Used oil can look like CRUDE.

OIL floats on top of water, so if there was a situation down there - you  MIGHT SEE water droplets on the oil dipstick otherwise NOTHING except the oil level was higher than the highest line on the dipstick.  Oil never stays pure like golden honey if you been running the engine.  Now it is changing color to a brown and later to a black.  That is soot from gasoline burning inside the engine aka CARBON.Your engine has a temp sensor which is connected to the red light on the speedometer that shows coolant temp.  When it flashes on while driving, then you are overheating for some reason. (most times a quick look would show that you blew a rad hose and all the coolant is on the highway a few miles back.)  Coolant has been sitting in my engine for 13 years, in my other car for 51 years.(where it is suppose to be). You think it is hot? Consider the thermostat is at least 185F then it is hot as a cup of coffee. That is cold normal. So you do not know what hot is... For long standers, the battery ages daily. 7 years maximum life on a 5 year battery. Then it is schit. Dead.. You DO REALIZE they have made head gaskets for the first engines? They have only IMPROVED SINCE.They can last the life of the engine if you never take off the head.  (That could be 50 years if the engine is never modified with a new bore or/& valve job. . You drained the oil to find coolant in there.  Maybe when the engine work was done, no one changed out the contaminated oil? So you been driving that way ever since.  .  Car did not die. So now the oil is out.  Put in new stuff, put in gas and drive the flucker. .  The damage if there was any has already been done and the car would run like a PoS.. But you say it runs good. .

If the resistance is very low, the O2 sensor heater fuse could have blown.  Find the O2 sensor heater fuse in the fuse box and replace it.
