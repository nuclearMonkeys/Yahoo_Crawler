Second, the formation of our particular star and accompanying planets is a separate phenomenon than the event that started the expansion of the universe.

	63472 : ["Posting a science question in the religion and spirituality section often means the asker does not really want an answer. His goal is to ask a question that he believes proves some scientific knowledge to be wrong, or that science does not yet answer, and make the implicit claim that the only other explanation is a god, and specifically, the same god he happens to believe in. It's the \"god of the gaps\" - intellectually bankrupt, since it favors ignorance instead of knowledge, and because of the contained logical fallacy - and it's done almost exclusively by christians. However, on the off chance that you really want to know the answer: Claim CB621: By analyzing the DNA of many different people, it is possible to learn the approximate date and location of their common ancestor. Scientists have done this with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from diverse human populations. Since mtDNA is inherited only from the mother, this traces humanity back to a common \"mitochondrial Eve.\" Scientists say she came from Africa about 200,000 years ago (Cann et al. 1987), but the age may be mistaken, and Asia and Europe have also been suggested as the location, consistent with an origin from near Mt. Ararat. Mitochondrial Eve is consistent with Biblical Eve. Response:    1. The \"mitochondrial Eve,\" to which this claim refers, is the most recent common female ancestor, not the original female ancestor. There would have been other humans living earlier and at the same time. The mtDNA lineages of other women contemporary with her eventually died out. Mitochondrial Eve was merely the youngest common ancestor of all today's mtDNA. She may not even have been human.    2. The same principles find that the most recent human male common ancestor (\"Y-chromosome Adam\") lived an estimated 84,000 years after the \"mitochondrial Eve\" and also came from Africa (Hawkes 2000; Underhill et al. 2000; Yuehai et al. 2001).    3. The results assume negligible paternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, but that assumption has been called into question. Male mtDNA resides in the tail of the sperm; the tail usually does not enter the egg that the sperm fertilizes, but rarely a little bit does. It is also possible that there is some recombination of mtDNA between lineages, which would also affect the results (Awadalla et al. 1999; Eyre-Walker et al. 1999). But these challenges have themselves been questioned (Kivisild et al. 2000).", 8207, "None", 14],
