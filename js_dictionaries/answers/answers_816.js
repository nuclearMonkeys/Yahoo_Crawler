Flash frozen and shipped to your local restaurant.  At a ghost kitchen, the grilled cheese is being made in a shut down Mexican joint.

However, many people also turn to raw vegan lifestyle out other ethical and spiritual reasons. Not to mention, that going raw is very cleansing for the body! So, if you've been on this journey for a while, have experienced energy boost, detoxification, maybe even weight loss, expansion of awareness... than what you describe about cold sounds like you've reached your plateau.  If what I wrote resonates with you, please take into account your environment: it is  much more difficult for an average city person to be connected to God, than for a monk who meditates on top of the mountain surrounded nothing but blissfull nature, animals, and warm weather. Therefore you will be craving compensation for that until your mind fully reshapes. Instead of bread and fried vegetables, try lightly cooked/steamed green vegan options. Hot spicy vegetable soups will always warm you up. And grains will help you stay focused, especially if you eat them at lunch. ", 6519, "lAGatG40aa", 0],
