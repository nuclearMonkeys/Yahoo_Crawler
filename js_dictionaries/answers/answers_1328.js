	72012 : ["The Antarctic ice shelves are certainly in danger. Read up about the Larson B ice shelf, or rather, the former shelf. Mainly there is a far greater mass of ice in Antarctica than there is in the Arctic, where much of the ice is just one or two years old and melts and reforms seasonally. The Arctic ice cap has water beneath it, while Antarctica has insulating land beneath most of it's ice pack, and where the ice shelves extend into the Southern Ocean they are far thicker than Arctic ice.

So even it you do live very close to sea level you'll still have plenty of time to raise a family and move elsewhere before it's an issue. Global temperatures have stopped rising.  The North Pole is not melting away (nor is the South Pole which is increasing its ice mass). The University of Illinois updates all the polar data regularly.    If you really want to satisfy yourself the the North Pole is still frozen then I recommend NASA's daily satellite pic's. No need to panic yet.", 8665, "UNfB8FW8aa", 2],

	72023 : ["First let us interject a small piece of reality here 60 meters is about 200 feet. This is approximately the rise that occurred at the end of the ice age 10,000 years ago. To get this rise required the melting of glacier's that covered north America down nearly to the mason Dixon line to a thickness of about 1 to 2 miles. They also covered most of Europe and Asia. There is not that much ice left on the face of the earth. If every piece of ice on earth melted it could possibly at the absolute maximum raise sea levels worldwide by 6 inches. So either those who are promoting this nonsense know very little if anything about what they are saying or they are saying these things for financial or political gain. I feel it is for both reasons this con is being perpetrated on the world.", 8665, "None", 1],
	72024 : ["Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is steadily increasing. Simple bookkeeping will show that mankind burns enough fossil fuel each year to produce about twice as much CO2 as shows up in the atmospheric increase.CO2 is a greenhouse gas, it traps heat in the atmosphere that would otherwise escape to space. This adds up to manmade global warming. I know Keeling isn't a liar, personal experience. I know how the quantum physics works, personal experience with CO2 lasers as well as college/postgrad physics classes. Governmental sources cross-check with industrial sources as to the amount of fossil fuel produced/burned. \"My whole point is saying that you can't say Global Warming is real or not unless your name is Trevor lol.\" I'd say your point is refuted. Edit: The variety of answers to your question makes a point that climate change deniers consistently ignore. Science is a whole. Answerers here have shown that they know climate change is a fact from a variety of different approaches, not just \"climate science.\" Ice imaging, ice core history, satellite temperatures, quantum physics, atmospheric physics, ocean chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, astronomy, all are studies that bear on global warming. You can come to the same conclusion from any number of approaches within these sciences and others. Anyone attempting to fudge the data would be quickly refuted by a number of people in other disciplines. Unlike politics, where you can consistently get away with lying, science just doesn't work that way.", 8665, "None", 0],

	72028 : ["This, of course, is the big question to which, as yet, there is no simple answer. There are so many factors involved including quite a lot of reinforcers (e.g. more warmth = melting ice caps = less sunlight reflected = more warmth) and many unknown variables (e.g. what will humans do?) that we cannot predict one way or another. Notice this means that will I would be sceptical if someone said that it is certain that both ice caps would melt, I am also sceptical of anyone who says they won't or that it would take 1,000 years, etc. We simply don't understand all the variables well enough. For example, recent research suggests that liquid water builds up underneath ice sheets that help them detach (slide) off the land into gigantic icebergs (like the 7 sq mile one off Canada last month) that can drift into warm seas melting much faster but who knows? However, to answer your other question, keiths 81's is right - 60-80m is about it - but so is Ynot - trouble will start long before complete melting occurs. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) says that \"several million residents in low-lying areas could be displaced in the next few decades.  Low-lying coastal areas constitute only two percent of the total land surface of the earth, but contain 10 percent of the world's current population.\" \"Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, may lose up to one-fifth of its surface area if the sea level rises by one metre.\" - we don't need to wait for a rise of 60-70m! Finally, I do wish to challenge DaveH's complacency: He says \"the sea level will [only] rise between 8 inches and two feet by the end of the century\". Two feet is enough to displace hundreds of millions of people - most of them in developing countries, especially Asia. Where will they go? WIll the USA take them in (as the biggest polluter it surely has a moral duty to do so)? If the developed world won't take them, what will happen? Will they accept starvation & disease or might they try force? Global warming is a global issue - even if you live in Boulder at 1600m asl, you will be affected in some way. The idea that \"even it you do live very close to sea level you'll still have plenty of time to raise a family and move elsewhere before it's an issue\" is like advising people to go under a tree to shelter from the rain and even if that tree gets so wet that it doesn't shelter you anymore, you can always stand under another... ...by the time you and your family want to move somewhere else, others will have got there first!", 8665, "5fe1c091ae94965162bfef0dcefbf9d6aa", -3],

	72032 : ["All of television is paid for by the advertisers and and estimated 20-30 million consumers would suddenly not be able to see TV shows or commercials.  Since Advertising is a multi-Billion dollar industry and loosely based on number of viewers & market share, and it is already suffering with the change away from print ads to internet, economists were worried the drop in viewers would create a ripple effect through the economy. Add in competition from China for Oil, the problems of the real-estate bubble bursting, etc., and the dropping of analog signals could turn our recession into a depression. So the government tried to shore-up the economy & tax revenues by making it easier to buy a budget converter box.", 8666, "ofpmRvHpaa", 0],
	72033 : ["That would debunk religion so hard that the religious believers will start to think that it is judgement day. That would literally be their last line of defense for the religious people.

	72034 : ["Global warming, caused by either man or nature, will melt ice in both polar regions. The difference between the north and south is that most of the northern polar ice is floating in the Arctic Ocean whereas southern ice is mostly over the land continent of Antarctica. Ice melting on the sea will hardly affect sea levels as it is displacing it's own weight of water, but ice melting on land and glaciers pushing icebergs into the sea will cause a gradual rise in sea levels.  There is so much ice on Antarctica that it would take ages for it to all melt and if it did the sea level would rise sufficiently to flood most of the inhabited and agricultural areas of the world.  However, long before that happens a small rise in sea level of just two or three feet would be sufficient to cause catastrophic damage to populations, agriculture, and industry in most of the worlds maritime nations. Only a few towns would be totally submerged but thousands of towns and many millions of people would be affected.", 8665, "q6phm94caa", 0],
