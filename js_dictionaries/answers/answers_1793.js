	95366 : ["Hey Jon, thanks for doing all of this, taking the extra time to settle things out. I apologize too for bashing on Pacquiao and his fans, I guess he really does mean that much to you and I'll try to be more mindful when Pacquiao fans make very bold and unnecessary statements. As a native of East L.A. and myself being Mexican-American, I grew up watching the \"Golden Boy\" and every time he would fight all mi familia would come over and cook carne asada and have a huge pechanga con todos, also I see the good he does here with him donating thousands to a charter they named after him and him opening up a technology center for alot of the underpriveliged here in East L.A., I know he's the not perfect boxer nor the perfect person, but I would always get ticked off when you would post severe anti-ODLH questions, I'm pretty sure I'd get banned from all the Pac fans if I posted up a non-question topic calling Pacquiao an adulter who slept with a stripper, exploit him and call him a FLIP or any attacking his personal life. It's all good though, if anything, all of us here are the ones keeping boxing alive.", 9540, "iTwi0w5Jaa", 4],
	95367 : ["Yes, to mention if you are a Pacquiao fan, you are no longer a truly fan of boxing...those are the identical men who say, if do not particularly recognise boxing except you could have boxed. I feel it is reasonable to mention that if you're a Pactard, (and a couple of questions in this discussion board have spoke back what that's) that you just no longer neccesarily a boxing fan...however a specific Pac fan can recognise boxing. Just like each and every game, you watch, you regularly have a favourite workforce, golfer, fighter, and many others. I'm a Pac fan, however I additionally admire boxing while, and despite the fact that I'm no longer a hardcore boxing fan, I do not watch ESPN Friday Night Fights on a consistent foundation, nor do I recognise who was once the welterweight champion in 1978, I bear in mind myself proficient on present boxing subjects and experience well fights even if Pac is not combating. Can't stay up for the Mosley Berto battle, Margarito Mosley was once AMAZING, JMM vs. Baby Bull was once unwell...ODLH vs. Mayweather...good I fell asleep. Anyway, Pactards worship of Pacquiao borders on idoltry they usually think that Pac can knock out Sugar Ray Robinson, Tyson, the Klitschko brothers within the first circular, and sure they get worrying. It's those men who supply us specific Pac and boxing lovers a foul title.", 9540, "None", 0],
