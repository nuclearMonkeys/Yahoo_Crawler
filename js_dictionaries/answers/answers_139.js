The environment has a lot to do with whether a person becomes a criminal. Many criminals commit crimes because of poverty, and many do so simply because they are greedy, not because they are starving. Further, there are also cases of injustice in which innocent folks were falsely convicted of crimes. They did nothing wrong, but they are labeled criminals. To suggest that people who are falsely accused will have children who willfully break the law is simply ludicrous.  One real way to find out is to see if the descendants of criminals are more likely to commit a crime than the average person if they are raised by people other than their biological parents. ", 1124, "None", 1],

	6983 : ["The Germanic tribes include Norwegians, Danes and Swedes, some Russians and most Germans.  Their ancestors migrated to the area from the Balkans region.  The Irish, most Brits, most French and Spaniards are Western Europeans. Western Europeans originated in the Caucasus region.  Some Brits are Germanic, but some Germans are Western Europeans. Finns from the western part of the country are close relatives of Swedes, but those from the east appeared to be farmers who migrated there from the Ural Mountains region about 4,000 years ago. Nordic is a term that is often used to lump most northern Europeans with cold adapted features such as very light-skin, thin lips and narrow nose bridges, to distinguish them from darker skinned southern Europeans from Greece and southern Italy. People from Greece and southern Italy are close relatives of Arabs, Jews and Turks.  All Europeans are descendants of migrants from Central Asia about 40,000 years ago. The Central Asians evolved from Africans who migrated from Africa to Central Asia 60,000 years ago. About 24,000 years ago, the ice age reached its maximum and most of northern Europe was uninhabitable, covered by miles thick ice sheets. So, many Europeans migrated south, most of them ending up in the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, although some went all the way south to sub-Saharan Africa.  After the ice age ended 13,000 years ago, some of these people migrated back to Europe from West Asia. When agriculture was invented 10,000 years ago, the expanding populations in the Middle East resulted in yet another wave of migrations to Europe. ", 1126, "None", 1],

	6986 : ["No Albinism is not a skincolour", 1128, "None", 1],
	6987 : ["No. Albinism is a phenotype. A phenotype is something we can observe based on a particular genotype. In this case the phenotype is the lack of dark pigment. It takes many different genes to produce the dark pigment eumelanin, which makes skin, hair, and eyes dark brown to black. Therefore there is more than a single genotype that is responsible for albinism.  If there is a mutation of any of these genes that disables the production of eumelanin, then the person will have albinism.  \"White\" people are NOT albinos. They have the ability to produce eumelanin. For example, when a white person or a fair skinned Asian is exposed to the sun, his/her skin can turn darker because the sunlight stimulates the production of eumelanin.  Albinos cannot get a tan at all no matter how long they expose themselves to the sun because they simply cannot produce any eumelanin due to mutation(s). Nevertheless some white folks cannot produce much eumelanin at all and they remain light-skinned despite exposure to the sun. They are not considered albinos because genetically all the genes that they have to produce eumelanin still work. Besides, scientists find that skin color cannot be used to distinguish one population of humans from another because within any population of humans, there people with different shades of skin colors. In fact the difference in skin color within a population is much greater than the difference between 2 populations. The same is true of any other feature, whether it is hair texture, blood type, or other characteristics. That is why scientists no longer recognize human races scientifically, even if they still recognize races informally. White people evolved light skin because their ancestors (from Africa 60,000 years ago) migrated to ice age Europe 40,000 years ago from Central Asia. Because Europe was so cold, they had to wear clothes, which block out sunlight and prevents the body from absorbing enough UV light to make vitamin D. Vitamin D shortage causes rickets, a painful and deadly disease that can result in deformed or broken bones, and even death. That was why they evolved light skin to absorb as much UV light as possible while wearing clothes to stay warm. The Chinese also evolved light skin for the same reason, to avoid rickets. The Chinese evolved from Africans who migrated out of Africa 60,000 years ago and ended up in SE Asia. If we use skin color to classify people as white, then albino Africans, the Chinese, Japanese and other light skinned folks around the world will be considered white, but a European or South Asian who has dark skin would not be considered white.  That is why scientists tell us that humans cannot be neatly pigeonholed into different races. Besides light skin, cold adapted humans also share similarities such as a tall and narrow nose bridge, thin lips, bigger eyes, short arms and legs, more facial and body hair, a rounded torso, and more fat under the skin. These are the characters that make whites and the northern Chinese look different from Africans and many dark skinned people in Asia, such as the Australian aborigines, whose ancestors never lived in cold places for the past 60,000 years.  Just like skin color, these characters cannot be reliably used to distinguish Chinese and Japanese people from Europeans either. Therefore scientists no longer recognize human races formally or scientifically, only informally in communications with the public. ", 1128, "None", 0],
