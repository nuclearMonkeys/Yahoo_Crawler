	10559 : ["It creates another hoop for people to jump through, and one that can keep them from voting by increasing friction.  The results aren't necessarily trivial either.  The current Governor of Georgia won his election by a margin of votes lower than the number of people who were kept from voting by that states law.  Furthermore, your question assumes that getting an ID which satisfies the law is easy.  That's not always the case, particularly when lawmakers looking to disfranchise people try and make it harder.  For example, in Alabama they were going to close all of the DMV offices in nine of the ten counties with the highest black population in the state.  In Georgia the name on your ID must match exactly the name on your voter registration.  So if your ID says \"John Smith\" and your registration says \"Jack Smith\" you can't vote.  This may be particularly significant for people with non-Anglophone names, whose names might be mistranscribed by workers at a DMV or the elections office.  In South Dakota, the voter ID law required that your ID have a street address on it.  Why?  Because many Native Americans in the state, who tend to vote overwhelmingly Democratic, live in rural parts of reservations where they don't have home mail delivery, and thus don't have street addresses.  The reality is that in literally every single case, these voter ID laws are motivated by voter suppression.  Republicans don't like that they're losing elections and since they're not willing to change in order to attract more votes, they need to try and \"rig\" the elections in their favor by making sure that the electorate favors them more. Voter ID is one tool to try and do that.  Sometimes, they've admitted it.  A Republican leader in Pennsylvania admitted that the entire purpose of the voter ID law was to allow Republicans to win the state. ", 1720, "None", 2],

	10578 : ["Actually, the Voting Rights Act did have a provision by which covered jurisdictions could end their covered status.  Since 1982, Section 4(a) permitted a state to seek a declaratory judgment finding that it was no longer covered, but the major requirement of Section 4(a) was the State (or a county or city within a covered state) proving that it had not violated the Voting Rights Act in the last ten years.  Until the Supreme Court ignored Section 4(a) in its decision striking down Section 4, over 150 jurisdictions managed to successfully get removed from coverage.  Basically, Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act put states that had discriminated against minority voters on probation with the probation ending when a state proved that it had stopped trying to discriminate.  Nobody with a functional brain should be shocked that the states that were unable to prove that they had stopped trying to discriminate went back to trying to discriminate when they became exempt from preclearance. Outside of the decision striking down Section 4, I am unaware of any decision holding that it was improper to keep supervision over somebody or something that was still violating the law. We will see what arguments the conservatives make in the Supreme Court's current Section 2, Voting Rights Act case.  Normally, discrimination requires considering the context faced by the alleged entity accused of discrimination.  In the case out of Arizona, there are some practices that have significant impact on the Native American community in Arizona.  If Arizona did not have a large Native community, the practices would probably not have a significant impact.  Because a disparate impact test takes context into consideration, some rules that are allowed in state X will be improper in state Y.  For example, Georgia has a long history of minority churches providing transportation from churches to early voting sites.  So a change barring providing transportation or putting additional burdens on such efforts or eliminating early voting on Sundays would have a significant disparate impact in Georgia.  In states in which those practices have not developed in minority churches, such laws might not have disparate impact.  But conservatives are trying to move away from a disparate impact test (or even a discriminatory purpose test) in that case and instead want bright line rules in which commonly-used practices are permissible even if a state decides to adopt them for discriminatory reasons.   And the Constitution does give the federal government substantial authority over elections.  Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 gives the federal government the express power to regulate Congressional elections (overriding state laws).  And the Fifteenth Amendment, Nineteenth Amendment, Twenty-Fourth Amendment, and Twenty-Sixth Amendment (each of which protects some form of voting rights) have clauses permitting Congress to enact legislation enforcing the protections of voting rights in those amendments.  Which is why the Voting Rights Act has, mostly, been upheld by the Supreme Court even as judicial conservatives have engaged in consistent judicial activism to try to avoid enforcing the Voting Rights Act as Congress intended (requiring frequent amendments to the Voting Rights Act to fix the latest flawed opinion from the Supreme Court).", 1724, "e6V3xf8zaa", -1],
