By the time he actually was emancipated, he'd be an adult anyways.  He'd need to establish that he is supporting himself and living on his own, which means him sponging off you doesn't qualify unless he is paying rent. Tell you what, just have the kid committed to an out of state boarding school or rehab center.  Then he can either join a cult or the military or both when he gets out. You're young, have some more kids or just buy a boat.", 3223, "lMtLhjrcaa", 4],
	19386 : ["People are going through very tough times right now as the effects of the Pandemic are realized. The increase of gun violence reflects the temperment of desperate people as their mental health is pushed to the limit. The real problem is mental health and guns are being used as the vehicle to express that total desperation.  I am convinced if the mentally disturbed people who are dead set on murdering people did not have a gun to do so, they would find another means to cause harm to others. Remember, these people who open fire are not in a normal frame of mind. It is hard for us to make sense of these mass shootings because we are the ones thinking clearly. Therefore, we blame the gun because making sense of the gunman's motive is impossible to figure out.  It is hard to make sense out of nonsense. We need better mental health treatment for those that need it. But the problem is that a mentally ill person may not even realinge anything is wrong with then thinthing process BECAUSE their mind is already compromised. Where as, a guy with a gun to rob a bank is easy to figure out because he is not there to kill, he is there for the money as his motive. Consistent gun laws across the nation need to be practiced.  Where I live, I had to take a 6 hour NRA class, a written test and a range shooting test. After passing thuse 3 tests, I had to go to my local police department and be fingerprinted and consent to an FBI background check. All those procedures took about one month. Then, I got a picture ID License To C rry from the local State Trooper's office. Also, if my gun happens to be stolen, I (obviously) must report it stolen. Because, otherwise, if that gun is used in the commission of a Crime, I can be charged as an accessory to that crime. Gun ownership is a responsibility to be taken seriously. And people like me, who follow the laws, deserve to exercise our rights to own a gun as stated in the U.S. Constitution. The real problem is the justice system...breaking gun laws need to have harsher punishments and  stricter procedures to even own a gun in states that are too lean", 3228, "9MJS6I6Laa", 0],

	19396 : ["The problem is that not enough of the right people are carrying guns to stop criminals in the act.  Another problem is we need to stop punishing people for defending themselves and their property, and those who can not defend themselves. More cops are not the answer.  Cops are a large part of the problem.  We definitely need police reform.  But, we need court reform too.  The more anti-gun laws we have, the weaker we get, and the more crime goes up.  Outlaw guns and the outlaws will be the only ones with guns. Confiscate guns and more places will be robbed with knives. We are totally backwards on our view of guns.  Schools should teach marksmanship and give grades for it along with gun safety and respect for what damage a gun can do in the wrong hands.  If we want to be a strong country with the ability to defend ourselves, we need to change our attitudes about guns and the security of our lands. When the guns have been taken away, the remainder of your rights will go as well. .", 3196, "5P6m4Gs4aa", 9],

I guarantee at least 1 of their 14 lawyers has spent the last 10 months preparing for the possibility of Chauvin testifying. He would probably be on the stand for at least a week. That's not how the defense would want to end the trial.  So, I don't see that he brings much positive evidence to the case but it would bring a lot of negatives.  Maybe, if the defense was losing they might call him but the way this trial is going that would be dumb,  So it was purely a strategic decision. ", 3230, "None", 4],
