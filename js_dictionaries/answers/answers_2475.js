	129577 : ["First off, Adam and Eve weren't children, Adam was fully man and Eve fully woman. Also, they were perfect without any sin.  So if Eve obeyed God and wasn't deceived by Satan then Christianity definitely would not exist because no Saviour would have been necessary due to no sin. Interestingly enough, Adam and Eve were made in the image of God; therefore, Eve made a huge mistake by not resisting the serpent by explaining that she was made in the image of God causing the fall of man. In addition, Adam did not correct Eve and instead participated in sin. We should look at this carefully and see that even ONE act of disobedience to God caused Adam and Eve to get kicked out of paradise. So God cannot allow one sin to go unpunished. We should look at our own lives and see the pattern of sin which God hates and turn away from our sins in true repentance, then cry out to Jesus as our Savior. Then live a lifestyle that glorifies and honors Jesus. Draw near to the cross. Without Jesus Chirst = Hell With Jesus Christ = Heaven If you die tonight, where will you go? heaven or hell?

You see them as the business interest of the American people. This is wrong. The corporations the \"liberals\" oppose are the massive conglomerates that work to squeeze out competition and shape the political climate to suit their needs. Viewing any regulation or tax on these giant corporate monsters as violating \"basic American freedom\" is the propaganda they feed to rubes and dupes, who in turn serve their agenda neatly. You buy their crap while they ship your job overseas. You subscribe to their services while they poison your neighborhood. And, in the name of freedom, you defend their ability to do so. These are not businesses in the traditional sense any longer. These are monstrosities that will do whatever they can to turn a buck as quickly and easily as possible, consequences be damned. And, while they're at it, they're destroying entire industries by hacking apart their investment companies. They're monopolizing our natural resources and poisoning our environment.

What's interesting is how the supposed \"business\" Republicans are big on policies they would never institute in their own endeavors. Look at Meg Whitman's California run for governor. As CEO of Ebay she raised listing and selling fees increasing revenue. But in her run for governor she spoke of tax cuts. California doesn't have a spending problem. They had a revenue problem. Look at Wisconsin. Scott walker didn't have a budget problem until he gave his business friends a $140 tax cut and stiffed the middle class with the bill. You're right about Trump. He hasn't been a very good business man and worse husband. 3 wives and children from each of them. He has leveraged his name as a celebrity but little else. What will he do as President?

If you do not agree with their opinion, or follow their example of the way they think things should be that you do not love your country.

The only thing I label as anti-American is overt statements or acts which leave no doubt that people do not love this country. Additionally, I do not fly a flag outside my house, nor do I wear flag lapel pins. I have served my country faithfully and honorably in the United States Navy and I do not agree with everything the government does in the name of protecting the homeland by a long shot. I am well familiar with your posting and even though I do not agree with you on some issues, I have never found anything which leads me to believe that you are anti-American.

I don't like lying to people intentionally) in any country I would think it very appropriate not ostentatious to be wearing that country's flag on my lapel.  Why wouldn't you want to wear the flag of the country you are wanting to be President of?  Why would you want be the commander in chief of the country young men and women  who are willing to put their lives on the line for. These men and women go into harms way not because they are Republican or Democrat. They go there because they have more trust in their country and it's leaders than many in here do. And this is what their commander in chief ASKED them to do. But those thoughts never occured to you did they? Did they occur to Obama? Ask him why he wears it now when he didn't then?

	129599 : ["See this is the problem with the christian version of Genesis. It's translated from ancient Ur, Sommerland culture thats very hard to translate because it is in symbolic picture form etched onto stone tablets, not words. The culture was animistic. I'll demonstrate what I mean. Adam - man Eve - women Garden of eden - primordial jungle Original Sin, gaining knowledge of good and bad - when man became sentient, self aware. Tree - geneology, family and family roots Orchard - other geneologies, their families and family roots. Apple - the fruit there of. Serpent - an energy, ie the uncontrolable urge to breed. Bearing in mind that it is a factual scientific theory of the creation of everything. It tells the story of how man gained self awareness. Eve, women cross bred with another similar species. The result, the apple, the fruit, was self awareness. Hence the great ones of old because they would have been a lot different. Why death became an issue because up until that moment, death would not have entered thier heads. Womens birthing problems increase because it is the most vulnerable time in a womens life, women die, its very worrying, again it would not have entered thier heads. I personally think the sin bit is where the pre homosapiens did not like their new clever children so called it a sin. To them it must have been quite awful to be usurped as the no.1 predetor.

	129605 : ["Well, first take into account general human nature. Some folks are very outgoing in how they express themselves while others are either inward focused or feel no need *express* themselves publicly as validation.  Then add into this the nature of your question, i.e. why do people *assume*. Most assumptions, perhaps all, are based on our own life experiences, our own hopes and fears, prejudices, etc. So sometimes people assume that if you 'loved' your country, you would be waving the red, white and blue, b/c that is how they express their love for their nation. So for everyday people [see politicians below], they assume feelings [love or hate]  and actions [flag waving, lapel pins, whatever] based on their own nature, experiences, preferences.  But also consider that some people demonstrate their love for this nation by participating in voter registration, serving as a citizen lobbyist, volunteering in public education, advocating for paper ballots, helping senior citizens, children, or the homeless, and many many more ways.  As for politicians, in some ways they are their own breed, and I don't mean that insultingly. It takes a lot of courage, personal strength, and resources to run for office. But our media has a certain way they portray candidates for public office, both during elections and after elections, so there is an ongoing struggle between substance and image. Obviously to serve with integrity 'by the people and for the people' requires the very hard ongoing work of both getting elected and then accomplishing good things while in office.  Often the public sees through this attempt at manipulation, but getting the public to educate themselves as to real options and then doing the work to exercise those options is at least one of the biggest challenges for a governmental system based on democratic principles, i.e. by the people, for the people, and governing in that way. There are many tools of democracy that could help our own nation if the citizens and voters would embrace them and push them, ranging from publicly financed elections to instant run-off voting, recall, proportional representation, and the list is not short. We spend billions of dollars here attempting to export democracy but very little on how to improve our own democracy. And yes, I'm sure it has occurred to some of these folks that their notion of 'love' of country is limited and skewered at best but until they learn a different way, they keep playing to the sound bites and the visual images. And the politicians and the nation as a whole won't learn until we the people teach ourselves and each other a better way. That's why I'm Green.", 11039, "236JsUSuaa", 2],
