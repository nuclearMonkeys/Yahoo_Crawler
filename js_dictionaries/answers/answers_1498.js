	80560 : ["this question has no relevance to anything, the fact that you have for yourself decided these two possibilities is ridiculous, makes no sense. You are taking two possible outcomes out of trillions and trillions. No one knows what will happen or anything of any importance, just what they are expected or what the world has allowed them to.  also, someone with such a high IQ could not be easily led that easy, they are most likely going to be  simple minded to things that may be very highly important to the person in option B. B knows whats what, he/she is aware of common sense and survival 50% of the time, whereas A has channeled his/hers mind to understand very little about feelings and other people, just science, maths, or one specific route. I would not fall into this category though. Thats my opinion. thanks for the question. Live fast, die young . . . have a good looking corpse", 9031, "Ekv3vgMtaa", -1],

	80562 : ["404 - \"THE METAMORPHOSIS\" Aired: 11/16/06 Summer begins seeing a therapist at Brown to get through her grief over Marissa's death. The sessions are obviously having an effect, as Summer blitzes through the five stages of grief – denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance – in one short week. She wonders if this now means she can get back to being her old, shallow self. The therapist warns her to just take it slowly.  Seth, however, is not taking it slow. He's jetted to Providence to make a last-ditch attempt at keeping his girlfriend. His old girlfriend. As soon as she sees him, she nails him with a big kiss and it would seem that all is happy again.  On the other coast, Ryan has become a bit of fitness maven as he recreates Rocky's beach training scenes. No awkward hug with Apollo, though. Sandy, who's at the beach to surf, tells Ryan he looks great out there. And with his job at the taco shop starting soon, and his acceptance to Berkeley valid for next year, maybe Ryan can start getting back to his old self.  After an afternoon delight, Summer apologizes to Seth for turning into a liberal zealot to distract herself from her own grief. But now, the old Summer is back. So she's pretty excited when Seth pulls Season Three of The Valley out of his backpack.  At home, Sandy is lamenting to Kirsten that suddenly he has no guy friends left. Jimmy left – twice – Caleb died and Neil Roberts is out of town. He has no males to bond with! Kirsten suggests he give Jason Spitz a call since he's always saying how funny he is. But…Sandy has no idea how to set up a guy date.  Julie gets off the phone with Dr. Roberts and informs Kaitlin that he said they can stay in the house as long as they want. Kaitlin assures her mother that she shouldn't worry. She can probably find another old guy to pay for all of her stuff and then cheat on her in no time. Surprised and upset that she's teaching her only daughter such cynicism and materialism, Julie vows to change. She's giving up men. So the Cooper women make a bet. No men for Julie, no trouble for Kaitlin.  Ryan is bussing away at El Pavo Guapo when he sees Taylor strolling through the mall looking for Seth. With Seth away, she decides to talk to Ryan instead. Because, you see, she needs a favor. Her French husband, Henri-Michel, is coming to Newport to talk his American bride out of divorce, so she wants a Yankee buck present for support. She fears his sensual powers influencing her in a bad way. In Providence, Che comes by Summer's dorm with a flyer for the next rally. She has a confession for him. The person she really is. She shows him her collection of leather, suede and calfskin shoes, her celebrity gossip rags and a photo of Marissa. Then she explains that her activism was just an attempt to run away from her pain over Marissa. Seth comes in and when Che finds out Summer has a boyfriend, Che's only regret is that he didn't make Seth a bracelet as a welcome gift. Decent guy, that Che. At work the next day, Sandy asks Jason Spitz if he wants to do…uh…something. If he's free, you know? Jason asks if he can get back to Sandy on that one. Across the country that night, Seth and Summer are watching The Valley and flipping through gossip rags. Summer pulls Che's latest flyer out of her garbage and Old Summer and New Summer commence battle in her heart. Ryan and Taylor wait for their morning meeting with Henri-Michel. But there's no Henri-Michel. Just his lawyer, who announces that there will be no divorce and he would like Taylor to return to France. According to French law, there is no divorce without mutual consent. Unless, of course, one party has been unfaithful. Holding Ryan's arm, Taylor asks the lawyer how he can be sure about her fidelity. The lawyer doesn't believe her. Julie and Kirsten meet for lunch and Julie promptly announces that she's off men. Now she can set a good example for Kaitlin and develop her career. That is, if Kaitlin will still have her back at the dating agency. Oh, come on, Julie. Of course she will! Just then, Sandy calls with the news that he and Jason Spitz have a man date planned. At the same time, Julie is off talking to Taryn, who seems to be recently divorced. But she won't need their dating service, as she's having plenty of fun as a cougar these days. Young guys just want to have fun!  Over at Harbor, Luke's twin brothers approach Kaitlin with a plan for procuring fake IDs. Kaitlin balks at first, mentioning the bet she has with her mom. But the twins say dude enough to convince Kaitlin to go along with their plot.  That night at El Pavo Guapo, Taylor has one more favor to ask of Ryan. She just needs his signature on some French legal document. Oh, don't worry about what it says. It's just standard boilerplate about her character. Ryan is simply a witness to it. Before leaving the document with Ryan to sign after work, she asks one more time if he speaks French. Assured that he doesn't, she takes off. In Providence, Seth is chatting with Che about his relationship when they overhear Summer leading a rally. She vows to lead a revolt against the school until they put solar panels in all of the dorms. Seth shakes his head at the return of New Summer.  The next morning, Ryan is trying to read Taylor's document with a French/English dictionary when Seth calls with his worries about Summer. Summer overhears him worrying that he doesn't fit in her new life and she assures him that even she is into green living these days, she still loves her boyfriend.  Sandy and Jason “Spitzy” Spitz are out playing some golf when Spitz gets a call. Spitz confesses that his wife was calling to make sure he was having a good time. Spitz, you see, doesn't have that many guy friends any more. Everything is so difficult these days. Man, oh man, can Sandy ever relate to that! Julie and Kirsten are working on the dating service when Kirsten mentions that she's all alone tonight and asks Julie if she'd like to do something. Julie thinks that would be a great idea…until she gets a call from Taryn asking if Julie will be joining the cougar pack this evening. You see, even with elective surgery, Julie won't be this hot forever, so she'd better have fun while she still can. Persuaded by that shallow logic, Julie announces to Kirsten that she needs to cancel tonight. She's suddenly not feeling so hot. Kaitlin and the twins meet up with their fake ID connection. Julie and Taryn get to the club. It seems that the Cooper bet is a tie. At the same time, the much more wholesome Taylor catches up with Ryan and asks about the document. Oh yes. The document. Well, Ryan spent all day translating it and he learned that it's an affidavit that he and Taylor have had sex approximately thirty times. She begs him to sign the papers so she won't have to return to France, and he objects that he has enough on his plate as it is. Taylor confesses that she turned to him because she had nobody else and…Ryan's defender instinct kicks in. Oh no! It's a helpless girl! Ryan must intervene! Except…he doesn't.  Che arrives at the solar power board meeting with a new recruit. Seth. Of course, since Seth doesn't attend Brown, security doesn't allow him into the meeting. Summer doesn't want to go in without him, but Seth points out that everybody in there is counting on her. He'll be fine for a few hours. Sandy and Spitzy arrive at El Pavo Guapo just as Ryan is punching out. Sandy asks Ryan if he wants to join them, but Ryan passes. So Sandy pulls Ryan aside to make sure he's doing okay. Sure. He shows up to work, goes home and does it all over again the next day. Sandy reminds Ryan that he can't check out like that. He needs to help people. It's who he is. Seemingly affected, Ryan tells Sandy he has to go help somebody out at that very moment.  Kaitlin uses her new ID to get into the club. That wouldn't happen to be the same club Julie is at, would it? Of course it would be! And it doesn't take long for the Coopers to spot each other. Luckily for Kaitlin's sake, Julie wonders if it was a drunken mirage.  Ryan the Defender finds a tearful Taylor meeting with the lawyer at The Yacht Club. Ryan apologizes for being late and gives Taylor a passionate kiss before asking if he needs to sign some papers. The French lawyer says he knows true love when he sees it. He'll inform Henri-Michel the wedding is over. But what's just beginning is Taylor's crush on Ryan and his soft, soft lips. So later that night Taylor finds Ryan at the pool house. She baked him a peach torte to say thank you for everything.", 9030, "e7272712180fbae68b247e8c9538786aaa", 0],
