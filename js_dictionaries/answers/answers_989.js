There are also many others too. Regarding dancers from India there are a few up and coming dancers who will shortly be in professional companies too. The issue in India is lack of exposure and training . Dancers need to leave India to get the right training. India has a rich tradition of their own classical dance. ", 7651, "BQtmmnFRaa", 5],
