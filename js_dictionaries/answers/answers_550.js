	30626 : ["I think your friend is being too harsh she didn't need to say it like that and there's nothing wrong with not wanting to be with someone who's out of shape even when you're in the same boat because what if one day you decided you wanna work hard and focus on your health and fitness? you might have to worry about if they're on the same page as you or not. One thing i've learned the hard way before is sometimes you have to cut out distractions and cut through all the bs and just go for what you want. Distractions include bad people and people that are bad influences because they kind of take you away from your goals and that would be counterproductive for you. I don't think that anyone should talk bad about anyone's weight but you're not obligated to date your friend's friend just because she thinks you two should date there actually has to be an attraction and a desire there to be together and if you don't have that its good that you're being honest with her and yourself.

Otherwise, a male with that height and weight and otherwise equal body mass distribution will most likely not look obese. One of the determinants of healthiness is whether they're fat from subcutaneous fat or visceral (internal) fat. Examples are a sumo wrestler has much subcutaneous fat but can be relatively healthy because of the amount of exercise they do and foods they eat and have little visceral fat.  A relatively thin looking Japanese man on the street can be very unhealthy because he has a lot of visceral fat inside his abdominal cavity and around his internal organs but nothing is visible and he appears on the thin side of normal. The dangerous fat is deep within. Too much visceral fat is unhealthy and usually associated with elevated levels of health problems.", 4709, "AQLIy01Laa", 1],

During this pandemic situation, I feel you should take extra care on this issue to keep yourself safe. It is better to get the things done by professionals. I got it done from LocalRamu expert team.

	30629 : ["Much depends on how it is done and why it is being done. Got dust everywhere even with a new filter? Pets and their hair all over? Best way to clean ducts is ti remove the blower unit, the squirrel cage, and high pressure clean it (like a car wash pressure). While it is out, they need to run a flexible water house from the outlet back to the furnace to wash everything out. May require removing the duct work from the plenum(s) and reattach after cleaning. Primary and secondary heat exchangers should be manually cleaned as well. Pet hair (cats usually) and dryer lint get into the smallest places. Yes, cleaning *can* be beneficial. But usually the dirt is not much of a problem for most people. Now what SHOULD be done at least annually is to have a dryer repairman come in, disassemble and clean your clothes dryer, clean the discharge pipe, then put it all together. Dryer vent fires are high up on the list of reasons why a house catches on fire. Not only would that reduce fire risk, your clothes dry faster, cost less to dry them, and less lint to dirty your furnace duct work & filter.", 4710, "41vWD9x2aa", 0],
