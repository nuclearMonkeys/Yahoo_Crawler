But in the case above i think that there is a possibility that it could affect him.. in any way of becoming violent but i mean he could get help.. but i think that it could affect him in the world knowing but he could go back to his own ways and at that time its like you don't know.. so i think that its just best that if he needs medication any time its best if he gets stabilized as soon as possible.. so that would help him.. thats my thoughts", 10022, "None", 0],

I tried massage therapy and physical therapy and could not take medication  I went to the chiropractor and the pain was instantly relieved. My hips and lower back were out of alignment because I had carried twins the year before. On occasion a Doctor of Osteopathy (DO) can also work but they usually only work on one joint at a time - the chiropractor will do your whole back which works faster. Anyone who does not believe in chiropractors will tell you they are quacks - don't listen.

My team losing the home opener with me there would be horrid. I drink pepsi while at the game, of course I bring a little container with my own flavor shot in it. The beer guy doesnt provide what i drink, so got to make due anyway. 3. The person that raised me is my MOM. If I was to find out today or tomorrow or any other day that geniticly speaking she isn't, she is still the lady that cryed when i did wrong, that cryed when I walked the stage, that cried when I said I do. I am the person that she calls son, so even if not by DNA she is still my mom.  Plus my team going to SLC would suck donkey balls. 4. I bearly have a pinky toe so guess team losing in the finals. 5. Sweet did it make the cover. It would be awesome to be that guy. People worldwide would notice me, I bet. Roosters are pretty fearsome though. Anyone else ever been attacked by a roosted, not fun.  I shall say rooster though, as I would LOVE to be that guy. 6. NOOOOOO. You mean I could have started drinking in 99 at bars instead of 2001. Wait I was drinking at bars in 99.  Team getting one point every home game wouldn't do. Then would most likely miss the playoffs and that would suck. So homeOT loses for a year is worse. 7.

	107937 : ["My deepest sympathies for your loss. It is easy for us to tell you it is all in God's plan... but when tragedy happens at our door step its not such an easy bullet to bite. It IS OK to feel angry with God, I assume you are Christian, and in Christianity God calls himself the Father.  In human terms, sometimes our human parents will do something to us and for us, beyond what we can see, like limiting our TV time so that we can complete our schoolwork or help us save our money for college and in the mean time we do notget to buy the really expensive Dress from Prada. In saying so, I cannot say for sure God has a plan or what that plan is, but if your beloved father placed full trust in God, then I am thinking you would too... seeing sometimes God gives us situations that we do not like... as a Child my TV time was like a Pot of Pure Gold. I did not see the value of homework and such.  Now that the loss of your Dad is so arresting... maybe its God's whisper to you to continue serving him by honoring your mom? God takes care of your Dad in heaven, while you be the caretaker of yourself and your mom on Earth, until you are able to have a family reunion once again somewhere in the future. Who is to say, that your loss does not propel you to be as great a man as your Daddy once was, the hundreds if not more people he had inspired as a minister towards faith in the Divine, Love towards Humanity and Devotion towards his Family? Maybe God has great plans in store for you and for greatness to be won, all the sages and prophets of the past had to go through much trials and tribulations, like the forging of a lump of raw iron into a pristine Sword that protects the weak and defends those in despair. Maybe YOU are going to be that Sword, it doesn't diminish the severity of your loss, but this loss can be used to strengthen you more or degenerate you, the choice is in your hands...  Be Angry! Be upset! Mourn! But once you are more at ease, Heal! Honor those around you... Love those who are with you... and honor the momory of your late father by being as wonderful a man as I am sure he was... For no man can invoke such great devotion and love from a child, unless he himself was truly a great man... Hope all will be well soon.", 10020, "53f230ab27419954d03352b02fa669a7aa", 1],

	107940 : ["1. Team not making playoffs. I ate enough pizza in my lifetime, I think I'm done with it for a while.  2. Team lose at home opener. I can just sneak in liquor like my family does at the Chinese Buffet. 3. Team moving to Utah. I couldn't care less if my parents are not my real parents, I have such a good relationship with them that it wouldn't affect me at all. 4. Team lose in Finals. The pinky toe doesn't do anything good for me, it makes wearing sandals uncomfortable. Good Riddance! 5. Back round of Sports Illustrated. That is just terrible. I can see how Wings and Rooster would go together so that's not too bad. 6. Team goes to overtime. If I am 2 years older then I really am then I can buy liquor in 4 years! Or I could buy it one year in Canada and everywhere else outside of America! 7. Hair grow on fingernails. I guess I should start howling at the night sky if that happens.

That's permanent, while my team will have another chance to go to the finals. 5) The new logo, because it's highly unlikely that I'd be in the background of a SI picture. 6) Having my team go into OT and lose every home game.

	107942 : ["Hi. I wish that I could take away your pain and answer all of your questions. Of course I can't but I feel compelled to say something just so that you know that you're not alone! I know from my own personal experience that God does exist and I'm guessing that if your dad was a minister you must have heard, seen some stuff to convince you that He does too. If u are unsure ask him to reveal himself to you and be open to him and he will. I don't know why your dad died when he did-i guess noone can ever answer that.  I am really sorry that you are hurting. I don't think that it's wrong for you to feel like you would have chosen your mum rather than your dad. Honestly we are all usually closer to one than the other and it is normal. In a situation like yours there is always a lot of raw pain and anger and questions as you try to process what is happening. In that stage all sorts of things can come up. God doesn't have a problem with you having questions but he would like to be able to help u through your pain and hold u close to himself. Crying is healing. Talking to a professional may help u a bit later but right now it is normal to just cry. So my big advice is to just cry and call out to God. If you need to ask him questions or yell then do it to release some pain and then let him hold u while u cry. I will pray for you.

	107943 : ["First, let me tell you that I am so sorry for your loss.  I've been there.  My dad died fifteen years ago.  That's what led to MY struggle with my faith...which lasted twelve years. It took me ten years to understand why my dad died, and I'm still finding more reason behind it. First, it brought my mom and I MUCH closer.  I used to think I hated her, I used to wish that it had been her instead of my dad, and believe me when I say, I still miss my dad every day.   The pain never goes away. As for whether it's \"wrong\" to feel the way I did, and the way you do, yes, in a way it is wrong.  But, it's NORMAL.  God understands. It's also normal to doubt God, and His mercy, when someone close to you passes on. My theory is this:  One must die, so that another may live.  Your father dying is just part of the balance between life and death.  And it could also be that you'll know later on.  Maybe you NEED to doubt God. My faith in God, and my love for Him, is deeper now than it ever was because I doubted.  Now, I'm not only thankful for everything I believe, but I'm thankful that God had patience with me. If you need to talk to anyone, feel free to message me.  I've been there, I know EXACTLY how you feel.  I'll pray for you.", 10020, "AA11212224", 2],

But the bottom line is that, we continue to go on because we are destined to. People die and are born every second, but time never stops and nor do the lives of billions of people in the world as a result of mishaps, accidents and tragedies. We should not be questioning God or putting ourselves in doubts about the existence of God Almighty. He is there when nothing was there, and only He will be there when nothing else would be there. Everything has to meet its end because all things come with an expiration date. In simple words, what if you saw a man with terribly long, curled and dirty looking hair walk on the streets of a rich state or country.. what reason would you present to justify his dirty appearance? Would you say that there are no barber shops in the country or no barbers? Obviously not. The reason could be any other than that because if there were no barbers in the country, everyone would have a similar untidy appearance. In short, God exists... we do not see it or want to see it because we like to see things happening the way we want... but it does not work like that... we can not control everything we see or touch or feel.", 10020, "AA10291338", 2],
	107949 : ["I am very sorry for you loss. Don't be angry with God, this is probably normal for some. Last year I lost my mom she was only 63 years old, in 1998 I lost my husband the love of my life, and In January 2004, I lost my first grandchild, she was born with birth defects and her brain did not develop. This was a horrible series of events. That at times have left me feeling pretty angry with God. He is real and he knows our pain. He lost his son, his son died for our sins. Unfortunately, when we are born, we are living a minimal amount of time here, and only God knows how long that will be. Death is the hardest part of life. it is very difficult to live and be happy after someone who has meant so much to you is no longer there. However, you have your memories, and you also have the knowledge that your father was a good man, a minister, which would lead me to believe he lead a very good life with Christan values. So, you should find peace in the fact that he is with God. Continue going to counseling, this pain does not go away over night. My eldest son lost his father when he was 6 years old, a year later lost his great grandmother and one year later his great grand father, then when he grew and had his first child, his daughter died and suffered a great deal the 10months she lived.  We must hold on to the memories and find happiness within them. We must find the blesssings within our lives and be happy in them. The blessing is that you had a father who loved you, cared for you and left you with these memories. He has left you yes, but not by his choice, and he has left you in the hands of your very capabale and loving mother. In time you will begin to heal and it wont hurt so much, ask God to give you strentgh and courage, tell him your angry with him, he already knows and he understands. I will keep you in my prayers, you will begin to feel better and  heal from your loss. Dont give up on God, keep your memories close. These feelings you are having are very normal, however, keep talking about them it is never healthy to keep your pain bottled up inside, even if you are talking to God.
