And then you won't need to ask because you'll have learned how to pursue a career at the acting school.", 2020, "Y4nBQ7wjaa", 3],
	12059 : ["You *pursue* wherever you live and only move when you're ready to start working professionally. You can't just go to auditions for professional jobs, they are not open to the general public. You need an agent. And no agent takes on amateurs or beginners, only highly-trained and highly-experienced talented people with an impressive resume to back it all up. There's no point moving anywhere before that, no legit agent will even consider you. Pursuing means working toward a professional career, not working as a professional yet, so you need to start by building a resume strong enough to impress potential agents: You get a few years of quality training in the form of a top-quality acting school (where well-known and respected people teach and successful professionals graduated from, not just any acting classes) as well as masterclasses and workshops and such. In addition, you get plenty of low-level experience in the form of indie and student films as well as community theater. You constantly land leading roles. You win awards. You also take vocal and dance lessons and master other special skills to give your resume a boost (like horseback riding, martial arts, acrobatics, mime, dialects, etc.). That's the kind of resume legit agents want to see. It takes about a decade to build it, give or take. Then and only then you move to *Los Angeles* (Hollywood is a neighborhood in LA, which is part of Greater LA. There are other neighborhoods/cities that are considered part of \"the industry\", just to be more accurate... You can also move to Burbank,   Monica, Marina del Rey, Silver Lake, etc. It's all LA). That's where the majority of the industry is. Or, close behind, NYC, with just less opportunities than LA but more for theater. You may also decide at this point to act locally, and in that case any major city will do. If you're interested in something more serious (and with much fiercer competition), then LA is the best place to move when you're ready. Either way, after you move you continue getting experience and training till someone you've worked with and impressed (like a director, a producer, an acting teacher or even a fellow actor) will be willing to refer you to an agent. That's how you usually get one. Other ways rarely work. So you'll also need to network and make connections in addition to everything else. Other than that, make sure to train for and get a day job. Because the reality is 99% of professional actors (those who've already secured an agent and started going to real auditions) will never get more than a few minor speaking or non-speaking roles, on minor production (including things no one's ever heard of) their entire career. Ideally, that job would have to be a flexible one so you can get out in the middle of the day or change shifts to go to auditions, rehearsals, fittings, readings, classes, shootings, etc. There's a reason why \"waiter-actor\" is a cliche. The reality is the vast majority of professional actor hold at least another job or two alongside acting. Understand that. There's a lot more to cover and you seem to know close to nothing. So I suggest that you do your research before you decide to invest tons of money, time, and effort. Backstage . com is a good place to start. Learn and understand the realities of pursuing an acting career. Make sure you can handle it. That it's not the fantasy that you're after. The reality of acting is like nothing like people imagine. Also make sure you have a passion for the *craft* itself. Have you ever taken acting classes before or done any real acting? If not, how do you know you even want to pursue it professionally? Or that you're capable of it? Take some acting classes, something low-key just to get a sense of it. Listen to the feedback. See if it's for you at all. If you're even good at it. If after that and the research you realize that it is something you'd like to pursue professionally, then apply to a top acting school (they're located in the big city) and start working on that resume of yours. Start saving money if needed and come up with a plan of action. Don't forget that this is show BUSINESS. No one's in this to make your dreams come true. You need to know how to navigate this industry. You can't expect to just move and be discovered. It doesn't work that way in real life. Good luck!", 2020, "None", 4],

	12063 : ["Sean Connery and  Humphrey Bogart had speech impediments of sorts often described as a lisp, they developed acting styles that overcame these. Doing that for a movie is manageable but it is obviously easier to speak naturally in real life. Broadcasters like Winston Churchill developed a mannered style to overcome sibilance - he was fighting the Narzeez, while everyone was fighting the Natsses.", 2021, "None", 1],
	12064 : ["Like who? I mean, there are actors from Spain that can sound like they have a lisp because of how they pronounce a soft C and a Z, but that's not really a lisp but accent. The way they pronounce S isn't lisped. Also, it's possible that some actors have a lisp in real life, a speech impediment that with concentration and a speech coach on-hand they can overcome when acting with the advantage of being able to do multiple takes until they can successfully say it without a lisp, or if they can't, then there's the possibility that it can be corrected in post-production by digitally removing the lisp and inserting a non-lisped S, not so hard because an S is non-vocal, meaning post-production doesn't need to find a voice match. The only actor I can think of right off hand with a lisp she struggles with is Drew Barrymore, which the nature of her lisp is a thicker lisp, albeit slighter than it used to be. Hers clearly comes from her being tongue-tied or having been tongue-tied, \"tongue-tied\" referring to being born with a lingual frenulum that congenitally attaches farther forward on the bottom of the tongue than most and so limits how far up and out one can extend one's tongue. When those who are tongue-tied press their tongue to their teeth or the top of the mouth to form the S, the frenulum pulls down on the bottom of the tongue close to tip and so makes the tongue thicker, which restricts airflow, causing the hissed S to gain some degree of the lingual fricativeness that turns an S into a TH. The fix is to surgically clip the frenulum back, to essentially \"untie\" it, but if a child being tongue-tied is caught and corrected only after the child has learned to speak, often times only after parents wait for the lisp to correct itself and/or after parental attempts to correct the lisp on their own, thus sometimes even being left tongue-tied even into young adulthood, it becomes extremely difficult to overcome the lisp because of formative years of saying the S sound with a tied tongue being engrained and muscle memory taking over. Moreover, people who have successfully overcome lisps very often find that their lisps return when they are extremely tired or when they're intoxicated. That's because they are making a conscious effort that is constantly in the back of their minds to overcome the lisp, but that conscious effort wanes as they become tired or intoxicated, so they unconsciously fall back on what their constant conscious effort overcomes, their lisp. Anyway, Drew Barrymore's lisp, especially when she was young, was something audiences found endearing, so it was widely kept in films. It being so endearing, kind of like Shirley Temple's, also means it was likely encouraged and not discouraged. As she got older, though, no longer being a child, it was less endearing and made it hard for her to be taken seriously as an actor, so at that late point, she was suddenly having to try to overcome it as movie producers worked around it by employing the various methods cited above to varying degrees of success. She does speak now fairly lisp-free, but it clearly takes more than a little conscious effort on her part, the effect of which is her speech sounding labored. She has to focus so much on not lisping that that laborious focus becomes audibly apparent, so it's a trade-off.", 2021, "None", -1],
