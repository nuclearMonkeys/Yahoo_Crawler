	126926 : ["Fact that catholic and orthodox \"christians\" are just heretic sects have been proved innumerable times from the bible and extrabiblical source like hindu scriptures.Apostolic church was protestant as it didnot use intercession of saints or used images/statues in prayer worship.Mani and his followers were direct continuation of apostolic church(they existed from 2nd-15th century).In 4th century constantine made christianity state religion of roman empire.As a result many pagans ignorant about truth of god came into church only for material benefit.The \"christianized\" their old idol worship by changing their old idols into christian martyrs and biblical characters and started to praying to them.Inorder to show others they were not worshiping idols they introduced the lie that saints in heaven could intercede to christ and we can pray to those saints(when bible declares jesus is the only intercessor b/n man and god),thus effectievely setting stage for an infinite idolatry in the name of living god as number of saints can be elevated to the status of intercessor.Thus these idolaters gave birth to catholic \"church\".Soon this heresy spread to entire christian church.Only mani and his followers didn't fall for this heresy and remained true christians.But heretic catholics branded them \"heretics\" and persecuted and murdered them.They spread from persia to china b/n 2nd-15th century,in the west they spread to turkey,balkans were they were called paulicians and bogomils.In 12th century 2 protestant groups called cathars and waldens were born which exist till today.By 15th century bible began reaching the masses and they saw catholic practices were idolatry.Thus protestantism became a revolution.Today there are around 900 million protestants world wide.Except for some churches that have succumbed to unbiblical practices of feminism and homosexuality(catholic lies)protestantism is growing rapidly.Catholic church will soon cease to exist as god exists.", 10916, "Ong8SIijaa", -3],

	126938 : ["No, this is messed up.   I'm trying to untangle your question.  I'm not sure which verse you are tripping on, since you did not provide any specific reference.   The \"elect\" is a broad term.  This is everyone who is going to end up in heaven.   The elect who have already died will be resurrected first.  When does that happen?  At the rapture.  And then the next group resurrected will be those people who are part of the elect and still alive.  Those are the true, born-again Christians.  They are resurrected (given new bodies) and taken up to meet Jesus in the air at the time of the rapture.   But there are more \"elect\" who have not yet been \"saved.\"  Who are those people?  This group would include those people who are \"saved\" during the great tribulation, and this includes the 144,000 people of the nation of Israel, with 12,000 from each tribe.  There may be others saved during the tribulation as well.  But since the rapture has already occurred, they are alive during the great tribulation.  And they are still part of the \"elect.\"     Where you have probably messed up is that you are thinking the \"elect\" mentioned during the great tribulation period includes ALL the elect.  But we know that isn't true because many of the elect had already died hundreds of years ago.  And it doesn't include those Christians who were already taken at the time of the rapture.  So the usage of the term \"elect\" for the 7-year period of the tribulation includes only those remaining elect who were \"saved\" AFTER the rapture, and are still walking around on the earth.   I hope this clarifies it for you.  Next time, include the specific bible reference you are referring to because it would save time.   --- (A Yahoo! User)", 10920, "TxgbQZKEaa", 1],

	126944 : ["There is often too much focus on race in the coverage of athletic events. Part of it, as Jimmy the Greek (embarrasingly!) reminded us some years ago, comes from stereotypes. Some of those stereotypes affect coaches. In track, you'll notice that elite athletes from the U.S. (like those on our Olympic team) have tended to be steered into different distances based on race: people thought of as \"black\" into running shorter distances, and those thought of as \"white\" into longer ones. Sometimes, it's worth noting when a stereotype is shattered. I happen to have just read an article about the significance of Simone Manuel's victory. The article was written by a black woman, who discussed the reasons that black women have NOT been competitive in swimming events. Some of the reasons are founded in economics and the inequitable distribution of resources: it's much harder for a poor person (of any race) to obtain the access to swimming pools under conditions that permit training for serious competition. Amusingly, one of the reasons she mentioned was cultural: Some black women have a great deal more trouble managing their hair when it gets wet. And expectations for hair management are often high. (You might remember that the President's daughter caught public flak a few years ago for wearing her hair in a more natural style.) This writer's experience was that when black youth swim in a pool, the deep end is dominated by the boys, and the shallow end is occupied by girls trying to keep their hair dry. Her point was that Simone Manuel's gold medal was, to black women, a really big deal--a shattering of cultural barriers. I agree that this is the sort of thing that ought to be mentioned primarily by people with that sort of special connection to the racial aspects, and the rest of us should just celebrate wonderful athletic accomplishments and shut up about race \"issues\" we don't own.", 10921, "FY4cCjsOaa", 0],
	126945 : ["I have never claimed Hindus to be pagans, I don't know anything about them really to make such a claim. But I will say, as a Catholic, that WE DO NOT WORSHIP STATUES. All worship is prayer, but not all prayer is worship. You have obviously been told this before and choose to ignore it because it does not fit into your view of the horrible Catholic Church and thus you choose to ignore the many people who have told you this isn't true.  No matter what anyone says, if they don't agree with you, you will not believe them nor will you give any credence to those who practice and believe what you do not. You have already come up with your ideals of Catholics and other Christian religions that even if you're proved wrong, you will ignore it.

	126946 : ["\"Pagan\" is an old term and it's actual definition covers a lot of ground.   One of the definitions is \"one of a people or community observing a polytheistic religion\".  If someone doesn't really understand many of the eastern religions, they can appear to be polytheistic from the outside. Definition 2:  \"a person who is not a Christian, Jew, or Muslim\".  Well, that pretty much covers over half the population of the world, including eastern religion. Many people misunderstand hinduism, that isn't anything new.  Many people consider it to be polytheistic, because they don't understand the religion.  But that isn't any great surprise is it?  Most people don't understand their own religion much less other peoples. Edit:  Misty 0409 is an excellent example.

Any cave man understands that if you accept Christ into your and really mean it that you will be changed in your heart and will no longer be a conman or a murderer or a charleton or a thief you will be bound for heaven. Jesus came for those who were not perfect like you. He came to save the lost, the people who had sinned and made mistakes. The only reason you are complaining is that you want to be forgiven and not change your spots and lie to the Holy Spirit but those are told about in the bible see the fate of Anninas and Sapphira they dropped dead as they spoke their lies to the rest. So be very careful how you tell your stories because that is something you never want to be guilty of lying to the Holy Spirit. it is unpardonable. Being forgiven requires you to accept Jesus as Lord then turn from your evil ways and live for Jesus. God knows your heart and is never fooled by your con ideas so do not think God would allow you to continue to sin. Those who will not change their ways are given over to the tempter for the distruction of the flesh.  watch your steps because God is watching and listening to you. receive your forgiveness and do not complain it is a sin!", 10918, "None", -3],

If the terrorist repents and rejects his former lifestyle then he may go to heaven but if he continuous on as usual, he will be condemned. 2) Some Christians do not read the \"fine print\" of this contract. True, he that believes in me will never die but their are also other conditions like works and forgiveness that must be accomplished: Matt 25:35 - On the last day, Jesus will say to those on His right hand, \"Come, enter the Kingdom. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was sick and you visited me.\" Then Jesus will turn to those on His left hand and say, \"Depart from me because I was hungry and you did not feed me, I was thirsty and you did not give me to drink, I was sick and you did not visit me.\" These will ask Him, \"When did we see You hungry, or thirsty or sick and did not come to Your help?\" And Jesus will answer them, \"Whatever you neglected to do unto one of these least of these, you neglected to do unto Me!\" Read the Parable of the Ungrateful Servant as well which teaches you'll be condemned for not forgiving your brothers and sisters. Neither do I condemn you but go and sin no more he tells the adulteress. 3) So in other words, based on scripture, simply having belief and Faith in Chriast is no 007 style license to sin with immunity and impunity as some think it does.

Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin; for he who has died is freed from sin.", 10918, "5wI6JRrRaa", 0],
