Where do you live? Do you have a budget?  I suggest looking into places like Bed & Breakfasts and Inns. You can also try some of your local golf and country clubs. They often times have rooms for smaller events that don't cost nearly as much as renting the ballroom/main room.  I hope that everything works out. I'm sorry to hear that your parents can't get along...but don't let anyone stand in the way of enjoying your special day. ", 11219, "rywgn8HLaa", 0],
	134424 : ["First of all - try not to be hard on yourself, and realize that it is normal and natural to grieve. It is human to grieve, and that it is a process that takes time. Allow yourself some time to cry, to be angry, to scream and shout, to eat icecream until it's the only foodgroup in your day - time to say \"this sucks and I'm really sad\". SAY that it sucks, and how it feels, and honour that it sucks and is unfair, that life is unfair and that the whole situation is unfair...  Then, take a deep breath, and move forward.  It's hard. Life is hard, loss is hard. And it just is what it is. You've just lost two things: your boyfriend and a bit of your independence, and it's okay to have a while where you feel lost and scared and deeply sad. IT'S OKAY. Cry it out. Write it out. Good for you for posting on here, because if you can say that you're sad, at least you feel it, and eventually, you can move forward.  Look at the fact that you have a mom who has taken you back home, to sleep in a warm bed. You have a roof over head, obiously means enough to have access to the internet - you will be okay.  Love is wonderful sometimes, and sometimes things smack us like a dead fish upside the head. It hurts like h*ll, and we're battered and bruised.. but this is life. There are things we can change, and things we cannot - mostly, all we can truly change is ourselves.  After you've cried it out until your eyes are swollen and your head hurts - go, find things you love. Seek time with your female friends, with your mom, and most importantly, with yourself. Learn to love your life, and believe me, you can and will if you let yourself. Get a haircut, buy some clothes just for you. Put on pretty underwear because you CAN, not because it's impressing someone else. Have a formal dress party with just your girlfriends, and serve champange just because you can. Celebrate your life and for you being YOU! It seems weird and strange, but so often in partnerships we forget to celebrate ourselves, and devote ourselves to our partners. Once you see that the world has not ended, only changed, I promise you - you can have an be anything! It's hard, it sucks - that's true and perfectly okay - but there is a world beyond what you've lived already, and there are many adventures to be had.  I haven't read your other posts, so I don't know if there is more going on, but I hope that you'll catch what I'm saying here. You have it in you to change your whole world, as much as you feel he did to you - grab life by the stars and show yourself how great you are! Don't measure yourself by the presence of one person in your life.. ", 11220, "fypgDK53aa", 0],

At the opposite of what everybody will tell you, please DON'T BE AFRAID TO CRY: IT WILL HELP YOU EVACUATE ALL BAD FELLING THAT YOU COULD HAVE, JUST DON'T DO IT IN FRONT F HIM.

When we are young, some of us are scared enough to fake being \"normal.\"  But, then we learn that lying to ourselves it NOT normal.  I was married to my first boyfriend.  We were together for 15 years.  I started noticing things about myself, towards the end.  I stayed faithful, but he didn't...and yes, I did continue to put out.  It was enjoyable...just, now I know it is not nearly as good as with women. ;-P  He didn't turn me gay.  I just got mature and comfortable enough with myself to admit it.", 11217, "iCPXdh7Iaa", 2],

	134434 : ["There is no way a neutered male can father pups.  There are 2 possible reasons for the mounting problem.  One is that males and even females will occasionally mount another dog in the house, to show that dog that they are the dominant dog.  It's their way to show that they are the boss of the house. Another reason could be that even though your dog is neutered, they can still smell a female's scent when they are in heat.  It still attracts them and they just react from instinct.  They don't know they can't mate or get a female pregnant.  All they know is that they are attracted to the female. Hope I helped.", 11213, "GT6396BDaa", 2],

They just don't produce any sperm.  But all the accessory fluids are still there and still passed.  I had an Aussie that I had neutered at age 3, well past puberty.  He retained the ability to breed and tie females for life.  His sperm count was zero,  but he could certainly perform the deed.    The testes produce 90% of the body's testosterone, but another 10% is produced in the adrenal glands.  So they are operating on 10%, not zero.", 11213, "None", 0],

You'll want to get to a vet right away to get him checked out; if he is still fertile, but he was supposed to have been neutered, there might have been surgery complications or even infection. If he's definately been fixed, then no, he can't have pups.  Remember that mounting is a dominant behavior for dogs, so he may either be trying to assert his place in the 'pack' over your new puppy, or trying to do what's natural to a pup in heat.  You definately want to get the puppy spayed as soon as possible; it's healthier for her and will help the two dogs get along more easily.  Unfixed dogs don't get along well.

It's only the minority that are aggressive, most dogs are around kids all the time. And if an adult's there, why not? Some dogs are very well behaved, guide dogs are an excellent example, and can be left alone with babies while the parents are in the other room. Plus, babies can't beat the dog up like children might to cause a reaction. I'd be more concerned about germs (if the dog tries to lick the baby) then about attacks. I wouldn't leave MY dog alone with anyone's baby for that very reason (I'd let her near it, of course). Again, if an adult is present, and can push the dog away, there's no problem.
