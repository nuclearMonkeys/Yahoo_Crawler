	104100 : ["You will need business classes, but you will also need all the equine classes you can get, then you will need to work under a seasoned trainer that specializes in problem horses to learn the fine tricks of the trade. I can take a horse that refuse to load and have them walking in and out of a trailer in 2 weeks with out any coxing, once you learn a fw tricks you can do the same. If you have the God given talent to train you can train any horse to do what it was bred to do. When we start trying to train horses to do what is unnatural for them, then it takes a lot of time. On the 7th of this month I started breaking a 7 year old mare who has had a couple of foals, last week I stsrted riding her, she now backs up when told and walks and trots wonderfully, we are adjusting to the canter, but some times it takes longer to get everything rite and make sure they are in the rite lead and not crosfiring.", 9872, "SRoBNj0naa", -2],
	104101 : ["Well, I agree and disagree with some of the answers.  It will benefit you to takes business management and book keeping classes.   But that is not the most important thing that will make you successful. You experience, success, knowledge, people skills, and ability is what will determine your success.  Being a GREAT trainer and reputable one is the most important.  So, apprenticing under as many trainers as you can learning about different breeds and hands on experience and turning out great horses is what will make you successful.  Most of your constumers will come to you via word of mouth. Most trainers will have someone to keep their books because you are usually to busy to do it your self.  Training is more than a full time job, it is a way of life and a lot of work.  Your days will usually run from sun up to sun down.  But it is very rewarding and a great life if you really love it. Good Luck in the future, Jenny", 9872, "UIM8X38Oaa", 2],

	104112 : ["That horse isn't aggressive he's SOUR to being stuck in a stall. So, yeah, he's got a good reason. Some horses will just learn to live with being forced into confinement. Some horses HATE it and never accept it. This poort horse despises being trapped in a damn box with nothing to do, no where to go. He MUST be put in a pasture or at least have a huge paddock. He'll only get worse and hitting him isn't the answer. If hitting him worked....then duh, he wouldn't be doing it anymore right? So, clearly, hitting him and yelling and all that garbage is a waste of time. Mountain lions will RARELY attack a horse. There has to be no deer and no other easy prey and the mountain lion's gotta be desperate to try and take down a horse. I know, I've lived in mountain lion country....and the horses were fine out in pasture. If the barn owner is worried then simply getting a donkey or 2 will solve the problem. Donkeys attack anything that comes after \"their\" herd. They sound the alarm (hee haw) and go after predators. cutting down pasture time is clearly not the answer and is the problem. Put him back in the pasture.", 9872, "R8wvlJmvaa", 0],
	104113 : ["Well I think you are a glutton for punishment.  However I always liked the challenge of an unmanageable horse.  I find it intensely rewarding to watch a horse calm down and go with the program.   I was lucky and got to see a lot of the old timers work.  I was from the Central Valley so I did get to see plenty of really great people.  I suggest you start looking for someone who does this work for a living and beg, grovel if you have to, to be his or her assistant.  Remember this takes time and patience.  Try to end the lesson on a good note and remember there is always tomorrow.   Knowing how a horse moves and a bit about his anatomy won't hurt and might keep you safe.  You also need to watch and observe.  Learn how to read their body language and expressions. How else can you know what they are thinking?  If you like to read, I recommend Bill Dorrance and Leslie Desmond, \"True Horsemanship Through Feel\" and Leslie Desmond's \"Riding with Bill.\"  Bill was one of the true old Master's, bless him. You will need some good medical insurance.  Or you can sacrifice and save the money as you go along.  That way you are covered. Happy Trails HorseFeatherZ", 9872, "mvtZ5nF0aa", 0],

	104123 : ["really good question.   problem horse training can be tiring, and it takes a certain type of trainer to achieve this.  also note that any horse that you retrain may revert to their old habits very easily.  so it takes a creative, out of the box thinker to train problem horses. Its easy to watch different trainers on TV these days fix horses.  however you have to remember that some horses take months, and some years to become reliable again.  You also have customers who want it done in a day. you have to know your limits.  you have to be humble about what you really can't handle.  there are some problem horses (and yes, it hurts to say it)  that simply cannot be fixed by you.  you have to be able to except that. i would honestly go for your normal training courses.  you first have to know excatly what is correct so you can develop ways of fixing the problem then, i personally would intern with a trainer who specializes in problem horses, one who has a good reputation and is good at what they do.  im not talking about natural horsemanship \"backyard\" trainers, im talking about a professional, who specializes in that type of thing.   business classes are the most important.  if all else fails and the economy tanks, you have something to fall back on.  im good friends with a lady who worked as a trainer at a ranch for years and years.  the ranch closed without warning and she was left jobless.  because of her business experience, she was able to get a job writing for an equine magazine.  Always, always, always have something to fall back on.  i know horses are our life, for people like you and me.  but realistically, your feeding your family should come first, and you should always have a backup plan to do that.", 9872, "Uzf5EP1yaa", 0],

If you can't go out frequently because of your health, you're going to have accidents for a while to come because she's not fully in control of herself yet. Nor is her bladder very big. I would try feeding her and giving her plenty of water and then STAYING outside until she goes. This is important. When she goes outside praise her rediculously and give her a little treat. Use your treats sparingly. A 3 month old terrier is smart enough to get the idea. Soon she will pee outside and then look right up to you for her treat. I wouldn't scold her too badly for peeing in the house for another month or two. Definately act displeased when it happens though.", 9871, "srq60GN8aa", 0],

	104137 : ["I am of the opinion that anyone who wants to work with horses should major in business and minor in their respective equine art (the only exception being vets).  In order to be successful, you need to be a businessperson first and a horseperson second.  You need to know how to manage your assets (including money), your employees (if you have any) and you need to learn how to make business decisions.  And, just in case it doesn't work out (a real possibility in todays and tomorrows economy) you have that business degree to fall back on (or to support yourself with while you're starting out)", 9872, "qsOvzhKkaa", 5],
	104138 : ["If you want to learn hunters, DO IT!! It's lots of fun. Don't waste your money (or your mothers) on something your not really into. If you're not having fun, you're not going to ride as well or practice as much. She shouldn't be late to your lessons (barring the occasional \"oops\"). If she happens to be, she should still be giving you the entire times worth. Or, you should only pay her for the amount of time she teaches you. If you're paying $45 for 45 minutes, start shaving a dollar off ever minute she's not there. That'll make her on time. Time = Money Since you're probably a minor, she shouldn't be swearing in lessons. Especially not if it's directed towards you (or the horse, or what you're trying to do). That's just unprofessional and rude.  If she gets mad, well bully for her. It's YOUR time, and what YOU want to do. Not what she wants you to do. She shouldn't get mad at you for wanting to try something else. That's one of the joys of horses, there's so many different things you can do! You are not \"turf.\" Seriously, she just needs to get over it. Not your problem.  Now, this is just personal experience, but my mom was a pretty good judge of trainers. She wanted me to leave this one I had after the first lesson (i was 15). This lady tell me I should sell one of my horses and buy a saddle. Really lady? (I was looking for a cheapish used english saddle at the time) That should have been my first clue to run far far away.My final two clues to run, 1) my big sweet and lovey appy was TERRIFIED of this woman (she had given other girls lessons on him several years before I owned him), and 2) my 4 year old who was relatively green to arena work wouldn't let her mount (he normally stood like a gem), then bucked like a bronco when she was on him.  I'm too nice. I think I took lessons from her for like 3 months. Then gave up. Took a lesson with someone else and went, \"Hey! This is fun!\" It should be fun, and you should be learning what you want. Talk to her privately with your mom, or if you think it's a better idea (and this is what I did to get away from scary woman) just have your mom call her, and say \"(your name) wants to take hunter/jumper lessons. I'm not paying for them to take dressage if they want to learn to jump.\"", 9872, "bIAXYEjUaa", 0],

My dog happens to be very inconsistent with going and eating(7 months old) I don't know the best way but I know 2 general methods 1. Sliding newspaper under you dog before he goes -I complete dislike this method, its very hard to catch your dog as you have to watch him  all the time, also by the time you realize, run to him,he's already finish or your sudden movement scared him and he won't go anymore on the paper, which also happen if you lift him on the paper 2. Locking him in an area for a week reducing the amount of newpaper which he can go on -I tried this way as soon as I got my dog(I was mostly dettached, now its unbearable for me to do it)  You lock  you dog in an area bathrooms are good, put newpaper all over the floow and everyday until he poops on the paper u reduce the paper on the floor untill there is only one left, u keep doing this until he poops on the paper.
