The father of communism's life and attitudes were shaped by hidradenitis suppurativa, said Sam Shuster in the British Journal of Dermatology. One of its symptoms is alienation - a concept that Marx, a martyr to boils and carbuncles, put into words as he wrote Das Kapital. The condition was described as early as 1839 by a French physician, Alfred Velpeau. But, Professor Shuster says, ideas crossed the Channel less readily than wine, and the true condition of Marx, then living in London, was never diagnosed. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a disease of the apocrine sweat glands, found in the armpits and the groins. The skin in the affected areas shows a mixture of blackheads, lumps that look like boils, spots and leak pus. Doctors and Marx, who was born in Germany, called them \"furuncles, boils and carbuncles\". Nina Goad, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: \"It is fascinating to discover that such an influential figure suffered from [hidradenitis], especially considering how it might have affected his work.\" In other words, don't take any of his psycho-babble seriously. His theories led to the killing of over 200 million people and are still haunting people in Cuba and North Korea to this day.", 985, "None", -2],
