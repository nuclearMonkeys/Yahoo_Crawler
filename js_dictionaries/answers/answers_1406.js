The area of the equilateral triangle is then (1/2)x(base)x(height). The base is \"s\" and the height is \"(s√3)/2\" (due the 30-60-90 triangle) Therefore the area of any equilateral triangle is [(s²√3)/4] And since there are six equilateral triangles in a hexagon, multiply the area by 6 and reduce the fraction to get the area of a regular hexagon as \"[(3s²√3)/2] This is the relationship I hope i answered all of what you were looking for =D", 8822, "B97V2Z8uaa", 0],

Generally, what you do with a regular polygon is: 1) Find the center 2) Draw lines from the center to any two neighboring vertices (points where 2 lines on the polygon meet) 3) Find the height of the triangle you just drew out 4) Find the length of the wall 5) Use the formula for the area of a triangle A = (1/2) * b * h 6) Multiply that by the number of sides you have (in this case, 8) So, let's see if we can relate the height of these triangles to the length of the base The vertex angle will be 360/n Divide that by 2 180/n Use the law of sines: sin(180/n) / (b/2) = sin(90 - 180/n) / h 2 * sin(180/n) / b = sin(90 - 180/n) / h 2 * h * sin(180/n) = b * sin(90 - 180/n) 2 * h * sin(180/n) = b * (sin(90)cos(180/n) - sin(180/n)cos(90)) 2 * h * sin(180/n) = b * (1 * cos(180/n) - sin(180/n) * 0) 2 * h * sin(180/n) = b * cos(180/n) Since we know b, let's solve for h h = b * cos(180/n) / (2 * sin(180/n)) h = (b/2) * cot(180/n) A = (1/2) * b * h * n A = (n/2) * b * (b/2) * cot(180/n) A = (n/4) * b^2 * cot(180/n) Okay!

	75945 : ["Hi Craig... glad you asked this since this is one of my specialties.  The hexagram, as far as I have been able to determine has no relationship with the golden ratio. Are you perhaps thinking of the pentagram AKA five pointed star? This is one of my specialties.    In the pentagram there are five isosceles  triangles. the base of this triangle is one side of the pentagon so formed at the center of the pentagram. the two longer sides of the triangle  form the sides of a point of the star.     The ratio of the long side to the short side of the triangle  is the golden mean or 1.618033989>. If we add the short side and a long side (1.618) the ratio to a long side (1) is again the GM. The long side of the pentagram (2.618) to the point side plus the short side (1.618) is again the GM. This ratio is found in all manner of ways by using the pentagram.     The circle of the Earth and that of the Moon are related in the pentagram and two such circles can be drawn perfectly within certain aspects of the pentagram.    It is almost metaphysical and this is why it appealed so much to the ancients. It is a genuine mystery seemingly projected from another, less material universe.!!

O and I'm a mother of 2 and about to be for a 3rd. I know that its very important to have a doctor and attend appointments plus take victims. Having a baby in a blessing, so as a parent you should want to give more than your best to your child so help your girlfriend take care of the baby by going to the doctors! I really hope you can find an insurance hope all goes well!", 8825, "z1rS5FOtaa", 0],
	75962 : ["Health insurance is not ALLOWED to discrimminate in terms of pregnancy because it is not considered a \"pre-existing condition\" even though she may have found out about it before signing on to a plan. Its within the normal realm because a lot of people reproduce obviously --its not like she has cancer & its going to cost the insurance millions of dollars for her treatment. If she isn't eligible for Medicaid--she can try to get insurance through her job or if you get married--then through your job. Or--she can pay-out-pocket for something like Kaiser Permanente.", 8825, "wWk1q5vRaa", -1],
