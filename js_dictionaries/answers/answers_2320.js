But if you do fight for Top Rank, then you have the potential to be a major star and are a can't miss fighter. I don't know if Bradley can become a star. He isn't a KO puncher, he's not an incredibly skilled Boxer or a good s**t talker like Mayweather (though he does talk well). He's a jack of all trades, who always gets the job done, even if it's not pretty. Bradley seems like a smart guy, and is a good family man too. But if stays undefeated and keeps winning, people will have to take notice of him. BQ: If Bradley joins Top Rank, then yes it's very possible. It all depends on if Floyd returns though. Pac is already set to fight Marquez in the fall, and even though people love to call Floyd a coward (among other things), if he comes back, then I think a Pacquiao fight is very likely to happen. Floyd loves money more than anything, and I've always felt he would fight Pacquiao, but only when his passion to get back in the ring came back. If Pac beats JMM, and if Floyd comes back, Bradley won't be getting the Pacquiao fight anytime soon. If Floyd stays retired, Bradley would be a frontrunner for a fight with Pac.", 10680, "CsADbqP9aa", 1],

Only about 4000 were built, it was a limited edition.  The second WW I reproduction is know as the \"Black Army.\"  It's more recent, 2010 vintage.  The finish is more black than blue.  The model number is O1918.  I don't know how many were built, many more than 4000 I believe. The WWII reproduction was built around the year 2000, actual production totaled around 3000, though they were supposed to build 4000.  Also a limited edition.  I think the model number was O1911A1. As you can see, these aren't the most common models.  Expect to pay around $1200. or more.  Gunsamerica & Gunbroker would be a good place to search for one.  If you can't find one of the reproductions, the Colt O1970A1CS would get you relatively close:  The Rock Island Armory Full Size Parkerized ($400. or so) and the Springfield Armory GI ($550. or so) are also fairly similar to a WWII-vintage M1911.", 10679, "KBsEallVaa", 3],

Floyd is no doubt is our best to date, but he NEVER completed a decade of boxing, because he retired for 5 months if im not mistaken and become unactive for almost a year recently. he stalled in welterweight where he still have competitions in cotto and margarito, he never give these guys the opportunity because they were undeserving apparently. he could have continued the superwelterweight after defeating delahoya and could give paul williams some lessons if he's bored in the welters but he opted to take a break. between floyd and manny, i think manny deserve the award. there is nothing closer competition with these 2 guys but they probably gave it to manny because of his continuity in active boxing for 10 years.", 10676, "805a76b8f5c2c8cc13c121d74753809aaa", 1],
	121836 : ["First of, its \"Fighter of the Decade\". I see Floyd as a boxer but not a fighter. There is a huge difference between a boxer and a fighter.  2nd. This is the truth. Floyd's recent fights were against smaller guys who moved up a weight class (Marquez from 135 to 145 and Hatton from 140 to 147). Then we got Shane Mosley. Mayweather and Shane were in the same division for almost 5 years, but Floyd did fought him. But why not before when Shane was still in his prime? And then Floyd ducking Margarito and Cotto.  This brings us to Manny Pacquiao.  Since January 2000, he has fought more the 20 times. In that 10 year span, he fought Morales (3 times), Barrera  (twice), Marquez (twice), De la Hoya, Hatton, and Miguel Cotto. 5 of them are future hall of famers.  Here is the bottom line, Pacquiao has a less-than perfect record for the record. But when a fighter fights the best of the best again and again, sometimes he looses. Remember Sugar Ray Robinson? He lost first to Lamotta before he became great. Ali lost to Frazier and Norton before he became great.  Not to mention Manny has an out-of-the ring intangibles. Manny is like Ali. A great fighter, a good person, and a good symbol for his people.  While Floyd, he is a great boxer BUT not a great fighter.
