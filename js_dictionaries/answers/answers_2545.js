	133086 : ["You are 100% correct. As a Buddhist (converted from Catholicism) I have seen both sides of this issue. My old Christian friends and family are shocked to hear I do not believe in God at all. We simply think Jesus was an historical man with a following that wrote the Bible as a map to live a good life. We have our own \"bible\" and it advises us how to practice our religion as well as to how to be nice to others and by our words, thoughts, and deeds show others how we are good Buddhists. Religion is a man made device that allows humanity to forge a path of happiness and respect for one another on this planet, while preparing the practitioners of various faiths for what comes after the passing of our physical shell. As a not we respect all religions and their right to exist. We do not attempt to force anyone into our practice, actually we are warned that not all people will be receptive to our ideals. And that ist is imperative to respect that. When people come to our residence and have Christian pamphlets and ask if I would listen to the message of Jesus, I always tell them they can come in and have their sat as long as when they finish that I can speak to them of my faith.

Here's how to fix it  Quick guide to getting Firefox back Firefox is now five, however if, like many, you've found yourself having to leave your favourite browser because of constant crashing there are plenty of ways to get your Firefox groove back and save yourself from Mozilla hell. Here are three steps to insuring you can surf the Web with the friendly fox once again: Disable all your apps With so many Plug-ins available for the browser, one of the reasons you could be experiencing crashes is that one of them has gone rogue. If this is the case, the best way to find out is disable all your apps and then slowly turn them back on to see which one is causing the issue. Safe Mode Firefox comes with a Safe Mode for exactly this reason - trying to fix bugs. buried within the inner workings of Firefox is a handy box that when accessed will allow you to reset your browser to its \"factory\" settings. On the Mac you can access this via the Terminal application in Utilities (/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox -safe-mode) while on the PC you'll find it by accessing the Run command within the Start Bar (\"C:Program FilesMozilla Firefoxfirefox.exe\" -safe-mode) Once you've run the application you get to disable all the add-ons in one swoop, reset toolbars and controls, reset bookmarks back to the Firefox defaults, reset all user preferences to Firefox defaults and even restore the default search engine, giving you a fresh start. Starting from scratch If none of the above has worked, you've got to take drastic action and make your computer believe that you've never seen or heard of this Firefox browser program. First off you've got to delete it completely. Unfortunately just deleting or uninstalling the browser from your Mac or PC won't solve your problems, as the browser buries itself into your computers profile and user settings. It's like pulling out a weed, you've got to get right down to the roots to clear out the infection. Mac For Mac users drag the Firefox app into the Trash and then remove the Library/Application Support/Firefox folder. This will remove Firefox completely, your bookmarks, browser settings, plug-in details the lot.  PC For the PC it's just as simple. First remove the program via the \"Add or Remove Programs\" tool then delete the Firefox Installation directory located at C:Program filesMozilla Firefox Reinstall Now you've removed all the traces of the browser on your computer you simply visit the getfirefox browser website, download the right version for you and reinstall. If you've done the above, your browser will reinstall and you'll be able to use Firefox like you did before you became a constant crash victim - hopefully for another 5 years", 11166, "meysHMilaa", 2],

In these instances, your computer loses control, eventually leading to a crash.At this stage the priority is to fix these registry files. In such situations it is suggested that you do not try to fix the registry yourself. Immediately find registry cleaner software and scan your computer to locate any errors.

	133114 : ["Miss Othmar is an unseen character (like all adults) in Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts comic strip. She is Linus van Pelt's schoolteacher. She was first mentioned in 1959, shortly after Linus was shown to be in school. Almost immediately, Linus developed a crush on her, which lasted for many years. After an extended sequence where Linus repeatedly forgot to bring in egg shells for a class project, the boy noticed Miss Othmar to be very upset, thinking his inability to remember the shells was the source of her woe. Actually, the teacher was having a romance, and eventually quit her job to get married (Linus gave her the egg shells as a wedding present). Now named \"Mrs. Hagemeyer\", she wrote to Linus telling him that she missed all her students, but misses him most of all. Linus floated on air (literally) upon reading this. A few years later, Miss Othmar returned to teaching, presumably under her married name, though Linus refused to recognize it: \"In real life, she's Miss Othmar!\" Ultimately, the references to her marriage were dropped, and Linus' teacher went back to being Miss Othmar again. During the late 1960s, Miss Othmar joined a picket line when the teachers at Linus' school went on strike. Exhausted from several days' picketing, she fell to her knees, and Linus rushed to her side, picking up her sign. (\"That stupid blockhead,\" Lucy huffed. \"He's become involved!\") The next day, she was fired. Her replacement, Miss Halverson (also cartoonist Schulz's then-wife's maiden name), met with some resistance from Linus, who remained very loyal to Miss Othmar. Miss Othmar eventually returned again. In the Peanuts television cartoons, Miss Othmar was voiced by a trombone, as were most of the adults. In an episode of The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, her red-sleeved arm can be seen while handing a paper to Sally Brown. Other than that, the closest the audience has ever come to seeing her was a shot of her from behind in the animated version of Snoopy!!! The Musical. Miss Othmar is often also assumed to be Charlie Brown's teacher. In the mid-1960s, it was revealed that Charlie Brown's teacher's name was \"Mrs. Donovan\". However, Charlie Brown did show up in Miss Othmar's classroom (usually sitting behind Linus) starting in the late 1960s. In one series of strips, Miss Othmar continually selected Charlie Brown to pound the chalkboard erasers, filling his lungs with so much chalk dust that he exhaled it for days afterward.", 11171, "ae33cd8bc30bc545944e1e9d3ab67091aa", 0],
