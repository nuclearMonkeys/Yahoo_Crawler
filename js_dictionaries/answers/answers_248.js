Several successful home remedies are irritating to the eyes such as rubbing alcohol and tea tree oil. Some home remedies are ineffective such a apple cider vinegar and baby shampoo. Some are untested and unproven such as head and shoulders shampoo to wash eyes.  Predictably effective is medication from the doctor. A visit to a doctor can also tell if it's something else.

	12408 : ["“Just because you can deliver a great monologue doesn't mean you can act” I disagree with that. A monologue isn't just a tool for the audition. It's a method to get inside a character's thoughts into the audience's consciousness. It's got everything to do with acting and should be delivered with the same emotion and intensity as any other line. “Acting is about making the scene about other character” I also have to disagree with that too because the way he describes dialogue, it seems that the other actor is using the first actor as a sounding board and that only one actor is acting.  Acting is building a fully fleshed character, not making the scene about the other person. IMO, it seems like he is implying that at any given time one actor should be acting which is pretty absurd. That kind of arrangement would make for an unspeakably boring and half-baked play.  If those two viewpoints that he mentioned above were true, then the CD would be crazy for using monologues as tools. Yes I agree that monologues do not showcase an actor's ability to interact with other actors, but it is very helpful when it comes demonstrating their basic skills such as the ability to project, articulate, parse the speech and connect emotionally to the material.  Let's not forget that many, if not, most plays contain monologues/soliloquys. Many are quite long, and while delivering them, the actor/performer is commanding attention/carrying the play without the aid of a scene partner/co-star but this is not to say that his tips aren't helpful or useful in this video. He shares some pretty good tips", 2072, "None", 2],
	12409 : ["In acting you're trying to create a character that people can connect to. One group of techniques that actors use to do this is called \"Method Acting\". The idea is that the actor becomes the character - thinks like them, moves like them - to make the performance life-like. There isn't just one way to do Method Acting. There are several schools of Method acting such as Stanislavski, Strasberg, Meisner, Adler, etc. The exercise most people associate with Method Acting is having the actor experience the emotions of the character by recalling events in their own lives So say a character is suppose to be angry - the actor would then think about something in their own lives that makes them very angry and go on to say the lines and perform. As opposed to thinking \"this character is angry so I'm going to make a mean face, stomp my feet and raise my fist in the air\" (or something like that). Instead of asking \"what would the character do to express this emotion?\" a method actor would ask \"\"What would motivate me, the actor, to behave in the way the character does?\" Usually actors have a tool box of various techniques that they can take out and use to help them in different performances. Most actors will use some of the techniques associated with method acting, but they'll use other techniques as well.", 2073, "4dIdBbOhaa", 2],

	12416 : ["You see, while the uniform developed around the turn of the century, tennis is an ancient game. We can trace it to a group of 12th-century French monks who, while at play, hit a ball to one another with the flattened palms of their hands. By the 16th century, the French and English aristocracy played a version of this jeu de paume with a rudimentary racket. The cousin of modern tennis sealed its place in the hearts of the gentry when Henry VIII built a court for the game at one of his palaces. Our sporty little shorts and polos did not exist then. While the king did own several outfits designed specifically for tennis, they didn't vary too much from his usual daywear. In general, he and his (male) courtiers would have played in tights and breeches. While such restrictive clothing no doubt taxed the Nadals and Federers of old, still the game spread across Europe. When tennis-like games came to the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, rich Americans too played in their day clothes, and were, you can imagine, a little uncomfortable doing so. It's fair to say that, around the turn of the 20th century, a game very much like contemporary tennis had developed and become a sport. But even then the dictates of modesty prevailed over those of performance—especially for women. Through the end of the 19th century, young ladies wore full bustles, dres' hats, and gloves on the court. Nonetheless, this era saw the first tennis tournament. And, eventually, practicality won out. Competitive tennis called for new outfits. It called for tennis whites! By about this time, the rich in America (and England) had adopted summer white as a symbol of their leisure. Since white clothing dirties easily, it didn't recommend itself to factory workers and domestic servants in a dry-cleaning-less era of weekly baths. In fact, really the only people suited to wear white were people who didn't work at all—or who could at least afford to look like they didn't. Wearing white costs a lot. If you wore it, you signaled that you, too, cost a lot. Since tennis had long been a summer game for the rich, the rich wore white to play tennis. And—since the middle class likes to imitate the rich—as tennis democratized over the course of the 20th century, the middle class wore white to play, too. Gradually, white for tennis became a rule, so that in 1890 Wimbledon mandated all-white outfits for players. Elsewhere, the all-white tennis outfit became a decorous standard by the early 20th century—just in time, by the way, for the Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen to aggravate rich people everywhere by playing tennis in a (white) calf-length skirt and short sleeves. American flappers, however, saw no problem with this. As general hemlines rose, so too—and faster still—did the hemline of the tennis skirt. American Gussie Moran wore an above-the-knee skirt to compete at Wimbledon in 1949. Her ruffled white underwear showed with every movement, and photographers lay on the ground in order to best capture it. (As usual, men faced easier fashion choices. They began to wear white around the same time as women, but their move from pants to shorts over the first half of the 20th century made little stir.) Unlucky Gussie. She was embarrassed, but a decade or so later, her short skirt was old news. We had reached the age of the white and the short, and most female athletes thought nothing of bearing their underwear while they played—or of wearing shorts instead. (Helen Jacobs was very first to do so at a major match, in 1933.) Over time, today's tennis whites became the standard outfit. Tight and colorful aberrances in the 1980s and early '90s met appropriate outrage.", 2079, "Pwqi7n4uaa", 0],

	12436 : ["That's a sensation you can get as the eyelid swells, even a little bit. That could be the result of a lot of things, like tiredness from too little sleep, eye fatigue in that eye from eye strain (like maybe because of now needing a corrective lens or a stronger prescription), a tendency to rub that eye (often unconsciously) when stressed or tired, dry-eye from excessive screen time (when staring at screens people blink less and over time this can result in dry eye), an infection in the lid (like a sty), and more. The thing is, since rubbing and pulling increases blood flow, it also increases swelling, so when you have that sensation and then pull at the lashes, you get relief, but what you did will cause more minor swelling, so the relief is temporary and the sensation returns. It's not unlike what happens when you scratch at a swelling caused by a mosquito bite, brief relief only to have the sensation that made you scratch it in the first place return. I suggest that you go to the drug store and get some anti-inflammatory, lubricating eyedrops, ones specifically for dry-eye. If you can't tell which ones you should get, go up to the pharmacy counter and and ask the pharmacist for help, not any clerk, the pharmacist. That's part of the pharmacist's job. The pharmacist will either tell you what to get or even come out and go with you to the eyedrops to pick out what you need. Once you've got eyedrops, when you have the sensation, instead of pulling at your eyelashes, put the eyedrops in. Also, adopt a new habit that when you're on your phone or computer, every 10 minutes you spend a full minute looking away from the screen. Thirdly, make sure you're getting enough sleep. Fourthly, if you wear eye makeup, look at what products you're using, specifically if you're using any new ones, using old ones differently, or using any that have gone beyond their expiration date.
