	127673 : ["Just a quibble with your Latin. The English word 'animal' comes directly from the Latin word 'animal,' which means (surprise) 'animal, living thing, creature, insect.' Latin 'animal' was derived from an earlier word 'anima' meaning 'air, a current of air, a breath.' This was expanded to have the senses of 'vital principle, life, breathing.' At this stage, 'animal' was coined to describe any living, brathing thing. This same word was later extended to mean 'soul' in humans, but the application to animalia (plural of animal) had already occurred, so there is no connection of 'soul' to the English word 'animal.'", 10946, "M5WfxjuWaa", 0],
	127674 : ["\"There are two basic possibilities for how naturalistic evolution can occur\"  - False.  There is no exclusionary principle that says only one method can be in force at the same time. \"Gradualism seems to be contradicted by the fossil record.\" - False.  Examples of many variations exist in fossil records where only sedimentary soils have existed.  Where igneous soils are involved, some destruction of fossils probably occurred that obscured some of the slow transitional stages. \"However, those same studies have demonstrated that such changes can only go so far, and those organisms have not fundamentally changed.\"  - FAIL.  The studies cannot have spanned more than about 150 years whereas evolution had 150 MILLION years - times 30!  Don't expect macro results in micro time.  This is an unreasonable demand that betrays ignorance of the basic concepts. \"Every time a person claims that the theory of evolution disproves religion\" - FALSE - we who are atheists do not claim that evolution disproves religion.  We claim that when religion demands strict adherence to the words of the Bible, THEN is when it fails.  Evolution stands on its own.  The Bible, because it is a single set of books with little or no contemporary corroboration, is like a single, faint voice in the wilderness, banging a gong loudly but signifying nothing.  In other words, we don't need evolution to disagree with what religion has to offer (to us, emptiness).  Religion fails on its own. But thanks for trying.", 10950, "aj5IBTuXaa", 2],

If the environment changes slowly you get gradual evolution. There is no difference between micro and macro evolution other than time/generations.   Saying micro can not lead to macro is like saying you can walk 10 yards, but you can not walk 10 miles.   Sorry?  What is stopping this?  Please provide the genetic mechanism that will stop genome change at a certain point.   Or shut up. Misapplication of a theory - or to be more accurate - your alleged misapplication of a theory does not invalidate the correct application of a theory.

Evolution has as much evidence to back it as gravity, another \"theory.\" the only reason that the theory of gravity is not so heavily disputed is that it doesnt go against anything that the bible fundamentally teaches, except a few miracles.", 10950, "trfuEiIqaa", -2],

Sadly, you fail to understand Evolutionary science and are simply parroting the bile that creationist keep spewing up. A scientific theory is closer to fact than any other type of theory.  In science, theory is based on physical evidence and a result or solution is posited based on the available information and empirical evidence.  The theory holds true until empirical evidence comes along to disprove or change the theory to match the new evidence. In science, they observe evidence, cause and effect and such, then base the theory on the evidence.

	127715 : ["Dear Libby I noticed from your profile that you are a recent newcomer to \"Yahoo Answers\".  Your question has been posed many times before.  I will say that your logic is sound, but will be attacked harshly by those that are evolutionary diehards.  You will be called stupid, ignorant or a moron.  They will cite the ACLU's website.  This website goes as far as to tell people how to debate Creationists.   They will also bring in \"every body knows\" statements such as one answerer did when he talked about transitional fossils, and that there were many that have been discovered.  Notice he gave no source.  Another belittled you by asking if you were ignorant of \"Nature\".  Now I will use an \"everybody knows\" statement.  Everybody knows that \"Nature\" is a publication that has a strong evolutionary bias.   Others will either ignore or play down issues that do not support their point of view.  I noticed that nobody explained how DNA, RNA, cell walls, amino acids, proteins and all the other things that are needed to maintain a cell all came together at one time and then lasted long enough to reproduce asexually. Tack on to this the whole process of sexual reproduction, and you have a huge hurdle for those that believe in evolution to overcome. Another thing that you will find is that they will put you and I and anybody else that challenges them in the same category as those that they say are absolute idiots such as those that believe in a flat earth,  (Richard Dawkin is famous for this technique.) and that the craters on the moon were made by Satan as he struggled against God.  (The ACLU website indicates that a prominant Christian preacher said this.)  As you would see if you examined the ACLU web site they set out the religious doctrine of atheism.  (They call it Scientific.)  And then tell their leaders and disciples how to win converts by undermining all other religious teachings. Once you understand that evolution is an atheistic religion passing itself off as science you will have a better chance of going toe to toe with them in debate. My daughter is a Chiropractor.  Recently she indicated to me that those apes that are supposed to be closest to us genetically have a different number of vertebrae than humans.  I recently looked at an article in the National Geographical Society. “Everybody knows” that they are extremely pro evolution.  They indicated that they had found fossil remains of the oldest human baby at 3 million years.  However most of its vertebrae were missing.  In the same article they used fossils that had been shown to be fakes, as genuine finds. I find it interesting that another discovery of fossiled human remains are not mentioned in their article.  The reason.  These fossils, (Ten humans in all, five males, four females, and one child) were found in the same strata layer as the dinosaur graveyard in New Mexico.  “Everybody knows” that dinosaurs went extinct about 100 million years ago.  Humans have only been around for 3 million years.  Therefore the find is fraudulent.  That's how evolution works.  (See below for the source.) Remember Libby, that the ACLU spends millions upon millions to advance their religion.  I think that the main reason for this is that they are too proud to admit that there may be a God.  (If there was a God, that God might require something from them.) Here are some web sites that you will find interesting. www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks.  This is the website of Geologist Don Patton.  He has several evidences that humans and dinosaurs co-existed.  Interesting. Another is: www.evolution-facts.com This is a website that looks at hundreds of different difficulties with evolution. A third is: www.darwinismrefuted.com   This is a look at evolution from an Islamic point of view.  (Christians are not the only ones that have problems with evolution.)  I found this site both large and well thought out.   I hope this helps, God bless Bryan", 10950, "AA11232768", -7],
