Priscilla's seem to really hate me and I'm fine with that. they just don't have to be .......Sorry my life.

If you are not selling product off your site you can make your own.  If you just want to put your email and phone numbers and do not want to put anything else why not make your own site?  How about free and you do it yourself or look for a program to make it yourself?  If price is an object then make it for free.  Just read on the web and do it yourself.  Yeah it is hard, but I did it.  If you do not want to pay money then do not.  You will just have to see how much your time is worth learning HTML or if you can learn it fast like I did.  I never had any experience in any computer language except the old language basic and I learned HTML in one night.  I have no computer experience at all, but that is just me.  I have a life science degree.  It is up to you and what you can do.  One of my previous boyfriends taught it to himself from a book called HTML for dummies.  Depending on who you pay it would probably be worth if for a business, but if you are willing to be patient you can do it yourself.  Just open your mind up.  If you do not want to pay then do it yourself.  If you want to have links to have people pay online and have never used HTML you better get a professional or this is going to be as total disaster. Listen to the person above.  You should have a website.  It amazes me how people in this day and age do not have them.  If you have a good one it looks better, but something is better than nothing.

A letter is most probably the best way to ensure that your invitation is received, in the multitude of emails many of us receive, it could be over looked, however a written letter in the mail is always opened.  Be sure to include a response card with a I/we will be attending or I/we cannot attend your party.  (there are no rules on how to word a rsvp, so just make it attractive) include a self addressed stamped envelop, as one is a lot more certain to pop this in the box if they don't have to go to any additional efforts.  A written invitation can be put on the fridge, note pad or whatever, and not as apt to be forgotten than if left on an email in box. Given the expense of a party for 100, the cost of some stamps etc., is probably not prohibitive to ensure they will arrive. I would definitely send this out at least six weeks to eight in advance,(you are putting on a large affair after all)  giving time to return the invitation, and do include a cut off date, such as please respond by November 15, 2009, so you will know what to order before hand, as sometimes a caterer or etc, does need advance notice. To get attention a friend of mine uses the french , \"répondez s'il vous plaît\", it adds some class and is very memorable so your guests wont be as apt to forget. A successful party takes planning and time and yes some expense, and seems you are a very good friend and the lucky individual will be charmed by the time and effort you have put into this affair.
