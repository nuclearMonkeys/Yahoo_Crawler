	121411 : ["That algorithms are fundamental & must-have asset for programmers. Comments Computer Science To answer your question as it was posed I would have to say, \"No, mathematics is not necessary for programming\". However, as other people have suggested in this thread, I believe there is a correlation between understanding mathematics and being able to \"think algorithmically\". That is, to be able to think abstractly about quantity, processes, relationships and proof. I started programming when I was about 9 years old and it would be a stretch to say I had learnt much mathematics by that stage. However, with a bit of effort I was able to understand variables, for loops, goto statements (forgive me, I was Vic 20 BASIC and I hadn't read any Dijkstra yet) and basic co-ordinate geometry to put graphics on the screen. I eventually went on to complete an honours degree in Pure Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. Although I focused mainly on analysis, I also studied quite a bit of discrete maths, number theory, logic and computability theory. Apart from being able to apply a few ideas from statistics, probability theory, vector analysis and linear algebra to programming, there was little maths I studied that was directly applicable to my programming during my undergraduate degree and the commercial and research programming I did afterwards. However, I strongly believe the formal methods of thinking that mathematics demands — careful reasoning, searching for counter-examples, building axiomatic foundations, spotting connections between concepts — has been a tremendous help when I have tackled large and complex programming projects.  Consider the way athletes train for their sport. For example, footballers no doubt spend much of their training time on basic football skills. However, to improve their general fitness they might also spend time at the gym on bicycle or rowing machines, doing weights, etc.  Studying mathematics can be likened to weight-training or cross-training to improve your mental strength and stamina for programming. It is absolutely essential that you practice your basic programming skills but studying mathematics is an incredible mental work-out that improves your core analytic ability.", 10660, "S0aRYghqaa", 0],

	121423 : ["The gravitational attraction of the moon for the earth is stronger on the side closest to the moon, so it attracts the ocean water, which is free to move, toward the sublunar point, creating a high tide.  But the gravity also attracts the earth away from the ocean water on the other side, creating a high tide there as well.  The earth's rotation causes the tides to move around the earth; the friction causes the earth's rotation to slow slightly, and the moon's distance from the earth to increase (presently at about an inch a year).", 10665, "None", 0],
	121424 : ["For the best answers, search on this site  How do the movements of the sun and the moon affect tide? The gravitational pull of the moon tugs on the surface of the ocean until its surface mounds up and outward in the direction of the moon. When the mound of water has reached its highest point it is called high tide. On the opposite side of the earth from the moon, the centrifugal force caused by the earth's rotation produces another mound of water and high tide. Between these two high tides are two flat areas on the surface of the ocean which are the low tides. Each day there are two high tides and two low tides. The time between high and low tide is a little over 6 hours and the entire tidal cycle repeats itself four times each day. The regularity of the tides corresponds to the regular orbit of the moon around the earth and the rotation of the earth as it orbits around the sun.", 10665, "None", 0],
