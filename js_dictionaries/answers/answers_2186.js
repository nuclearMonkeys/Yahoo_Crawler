	115081 : ["You use steam to re/shape felt hats.  Fedoras usually have a smooth surface -  they don't have much 'nap' to the felt - so you can steam press them without ruining the finish. Get a damp cloth, place over the bit of hat that needs reshaping, and apply a hot iron to force steam into the felt. The felt will become pliable/bendable and you can shape it gently by hand. If it's an older hat it may have gone a bit floppy and won't keep shape well. I've used spray starch (follow directions on can, but put a cloth over the area before you iron lightly) to add a bit of stiffness. A proper spray on felt stiffener (from a millinery supplies company) should work better.", 10413, "gB4OhVedaa", 1],

This is why you haven't gotten any answers to your question.  The best thing to do would be run an add in the local car trader for a used car, that has problems with the transmission but has a good engine.  You can find one for a couple hundred dollars, pull the parts you need, and sell the rest for junk.

With a 600 nine times out of ten you can give it all she's got and she will do it with out many negative reaction.  When you get on a liter bike you can't just grab that throttle and pull all the way back on it because it will just flip right out from underneath of you.
