	28070 : ["No, I don't think they disbelieve AGW because of Trump, I think that is one of the reason they are Trump supporters. Modern conservatism is delusional conservatism, because it is based on believing conspiracies and rejecting objective evidence. That made Trump the ideal candidate for the delusional conservatives--they reject global warming even though there is massive evidence the planet is warming, they believe in election fraud even though there is no evidence for it. They believe cutting taxes will increase revenue and balance the budget even though there is 50 years of evidence that shows the opposite is true. I give Christian Sinner credit for finding a NASA link that at least casts a little doubt on the water vapor feedback, but I wonder how old that link is? There is increasing evidence that water vapor in the atmosphere is increasing with temperature, as the relative humidity stays approximately constant. Also, I question who ever wrote the original link, because the connection between temperature and water vapor content of the atmosphere is obvious to even casual observers.  We all notice the atmosphere being dry during the winter and humid during the summer, so that's pretty strong evidence. I don't give him credit for the cartoon he includes with his answer, which is insulting and obnoxious.  I don't know what Christian Sinner does, but if he has such a low opinion of the ethics of scientists, then my guess is that he's not an ethical person himself.", 4373, "RhM1p6axaa", -3],
