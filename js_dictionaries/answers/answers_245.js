	12253 : ["NB, Yahoo have gone and censored a perfectly respectable word and now I have to make it awkward by decoding it.  The one word they dislike is e-r-o-t-i-c.   We inherited that in a direct line from the Romans, though it's hard to say for sure how much older the attitude is.  There are many arguments that trace it back to the Neolithic when agriculture spread across Europe although the evidence is circumstantial. What we can say is that the veiling of adult women in public as a marker of respectability, as opposed to both sexes for practical reasons, started in the Near East and was already established by the time Mesopotamia became a power.  Those of you who've read the Gor novels might want to know that John Norman based his rules on veiling on this civilisation.  The Ancient Greeks borrowed these conventions from the Hittites when they arrived on the shores of the Mediterranean from the steppes.  Some Greek enclaves took to the custom more than others.  Athenian freewomen were very heavily veiled and seldom left their homes as long as the household could afford a slave to run errands.  However, the Greeks were very free in showing breasts in art, not just in an ****** capacity, though women are depicted as being covered from the shoulders down when doing ordinary tasks.   Elsewhere in the Mediterranean world, contemporary Ancient Egypt for a long period of time depicts women as having uncovered breasts across social classes.  In ancient Minoan society the women's clothes are designed to display women's breasts.  They're not \"just\" uncovered, they are drawn attention to but it seems symbolic rather than ******.   Later on the Romans are super prudish.  They're happy to make nude sculptures of women as long as they're deities but as soon as it comes to naturalistic murals they get really coy and women in the midst of the most intimate sex acts are depicted as wearing a bandeau style bra and nothing else.  A respectable married woman wasn't even supposed to take it off for her husband, he'd have to go to a low class brothel to see breasts on the loose.  (Penises though are everywhere.  Romans drew knobs on everything and liked knob themed amulets.  They were considered protective emblems.) North of the Alps human artistic representation of the human body is sparse before the Romans.  In what we do have females come in two flavours, all nekkid being sexy or spiritual, or covered from head to foot and respectably matronly, although there's even some Bronze Age ****** art depicting men having sex with veiled women with covered top halves, the lower garments presumably pushed up out of the way.  It's always presumed by scholars that this was meant to convey that the woman is the man's wife. So, after the Ice Age and Mesolithic period, the little representative art we have shows women as either being very covered, including the breasts, or uncovered and overtly ******, or at any rate outside of ordinary life.  Some Neolithic archaeologists have drawn our attention to the fact that the Neolithic culture that spread across Europe weaned babies very young and even raided other communities for babies to raise who were then also weaned onto gruel.  From this point onwards baby weaning items are characteristic of the culture.  It means something, but what?   Nothing good, that's what.  The Neolithic in Europe was a brutal time.  It was all about quantity over quality.  The history of domesticating livestock is so grim it's almost enough to turn me vegan, almost.  You can look that up on your own sometime.  The earliest farmers didn't really understand farming either.  It was slash and burn agriculture, the land being made to bear and bear again without putting care back into it.  When their patch was exhausted the tribe packed up and moved on to repeat the cycle.  It seems that women were made to bear and bear again too....  By taking the baby off the breast as soon as possible, no one year, or even 6 months, exclusive breastfeeding here, the probability of getting pregnant again soon is very high.  To this day around half of abortions sought by women in western countries are by new mothers who got accidentally pregnant shortly after giving birth when there's a short, sharp natural spike in fertility hormones.  During the Neolithic the human population rose due to these practices but the health of the human population dropped dramatically, early weaning was part of this. This early weaning, archaeologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, and social-historians of the family have posited fetishised the female breast, particularly by angry boy infants who grew up to be angry men in a culture that needed angry men in order to conquer new territory every few years as the land was exhausted.  How did the girls feel about it?  We don't know, but in my experience boy babies take longer to reach milestones and are resentful of the transition period before finally getting the hang of the next milestone.  Girls seem to look forward over looking backwards.  It's not an unreasonable supposition that women began to cover their breasts in order to discourage their older babies from trying to suckle as they were still very much too young to be independent from their mothers.  They were still babies, not even toddlers.  This made breasts forbidden fruit withheld by the mother and something they were going to get ahold of one day when they were big and strong....   In hunter-gatherer societies babies are spaced at least two years apart with just over three to four years frequently aimed for as the ideal spacing.  The baby is breastfed for a long time and weaning is a long process wherein the child itself decides that it's time to stop.  Because babies are spaced out the young child has the sole attention of its mother for longer as well as the adults in its life being more free to provide intense interaction as their are fewer children around.  In these cultures more often than not breasts are just not interesting to adults, no more so than generally looking well.   It's always amused and disturbed me in equal measures that the style of breast augmentation popular in the United States is positioned like a breast in milk yet your breast feeding rates are low.  In Europe the position is lower on the chest and shaped like a nonlactating breast which is why Americans are not good at spotting at European boob job.  You're also terrified of the existence of female nipples.  I can't help thinking it's a longing for something, though I'd like to point out that in Victorian times a respectable woman could breast feed her baby in church and nobody batted an eyelash.  Even in America the prudish of the 1860s mothers nursing their baby was a favorite portrait subject of family photographers and considered to be an expression of infant innocence.  It was later generations who removed these pictures from family albums because they were uncomfortable with the very concept of breastfeeding.", 2055, "SHiRD91Oaa", 0],

Male hats off are a sign of respect but females must wear theirs as a sign of respect.  Women wear dresses but men do not.  Women wear makeup.  The list of cultural differences, that have no rationale, is very long.", 2055, "Y1NTL6p2aa", 0],

	12294 : ["Many practices James speaks of are traditional to compensate for other discrimination women faced.  In my lifetime some things feminism has pushed for.  Affirmative action, Altering assessment in education to favour girls, Equal pay in professional sports but NOT for equal work, A woman's word must be believed in an accusation which automatically means that the man's response must be disbelieved, A woman should have zero responsibility for what she wears or what she does:- it is always that MEN should do more to protect women ( presumably from their own childlike folly).", 2056, "Y1NTL6p2aa", -3],
	12295 : ["All of the following are legal discrimination against men in the US that feminism has pushed - It's all about a mothers rights, but no fathers rights. Women being treated like princesses in prison and men being treated like animals. Female prison guards humiliate and degrade men with strip searches, shower supervision etc, but female prisoners get privacy and respect from male prison guards. Men have to register for the draft and selective service, women don't. This is clear discrimination and shows women don't value mens lives the way they do their own. Bodily choice for women, but forced genital mutilation for boys, referring to women's rights to their bodies in terms of abortion, but boys being circumcised without choice. Female reporters and staff allowed in men's locker rooms, but privacy and respect for female athletes. This is the definition of feminist equality. Is this an example of the respect that feminists claim MEN don't have for the opposite sex? Its women getting everything in a divorce, and men being torn away from their children Female sex offenders being slapped on the wrist, but male sex offenders being incarcerated the rest of their lives Its men being sentenced to more time for the same crime than women. This can be researched under the US government and shows that women don't get held accountable to the level that men do. Women having the right to use the men's room, but a man who walks in to the women's room is arrested for being disrespectful and perverted. Men use urinals, but that's still not enough for women to have basic respect for men's privacy. Its a feminized education system that cripples natural behavior of boys, makes being male a crime in school, then girls claiming they are smarter. Why is it when two people under the age of consent have sex, only the boy is charged with doing something wrong? Its women being allowed to drown five children and using the fact she is a woman to get away with it - Andrea Yates Its women being allowed to use domestic violence as an excuse to murder a sleeping husband, even though there is no evidence of domestic abuse - Mary Winkler Its the extensive abuse of restraining orders to vilify an innocent man and get leverage in a divorce. A restraining order against a man can be served even without his knowledge or an opportunity to defend himself. Its men being jailed for defending themselves against an abusive wife, but called a wimp if he takes the abuse Its women demanding respect from men, but never having to respect them in return Its women having the choice between abortion, adoption, dropping an unwanted baby off at a hospital, raising the child with a father, or raising the child without a father, but the only choice men have is to agree. Its 3 innocent Duke Lacrosse players losing their lives because we don't ever think a woman could lie about rape - let alone prosecute her for doing so. Its women labeling men as abusive when the US government has shown women cause more child abuse than men. Its female rape being horrendous, but male rape being funny and made in to comedy movies. Rape is a legally accepted part of the justice system, but only against men. Its just about every TV show being allowed to humiliate and degrade men, but women complaining and calling it sexist if they were treated the same. It's more health care spending going towards women's health than men's. Breast cancer receives 7 times the funding of prostate cancer. There are three departments of women's health in the US government, but none for men. However, men live an average of 5 years less than women when the genders used to have the same life span. Its allowing women only clubs and banning men only clubs It's doing everything we can to help girls in math and science, but letting boys fall further behind in everything else. It's defining equal pay for equal work as men playing five sets of tennis, but women only playing three. Maybe women claiming 3=5 is the reason for the above point Its cutting men's sports in college in favor of women's sports that have no interest Its female murderers being mentally ill, but male murderers just being evil Its claiming men walk out on their family when its actually women who file 80% of divorces Its men being portrayed as evil, stupid or buffoons on TV and all women being perfect or superior. Its women wanting equality for their gender, but men being called chauvinist pigs when they want equality for their gender Its fixing the education system when girls are failing, and blaming the boys when boys are failing Its women being allowed to level false accusation against an innocent man without consequence. Read Duke Lacrosse and many other examples. Feminism has installed this right to women through the courts. Its a man being a chauvinist, sexist pig when he doesn't respect women, but a women who doesn't respect men is an admirable, strong and independent woman. Women remove male role models from their sons' lives, then when their sons behave badly, the women blame \"patriarchy.\" Stereotyping girls as inferior to boys in any facet of life is \"misogyny\"; stereotyping boys as potential batterers and rapists is a public service announcement. Married men who have affairs are selfish pigs; married women who have affairs are seeking the fulfillment they are not getting in their marriages. Women insist their husbands assume the responsibilities of being a full parent, but as soon as a woman files for divorce, he is just an ATM. Its feminists not being able to provide one example of legal discrimination against women in the US today.", 2056, "0598aff171be5b3a01a9295637d229edaa", 2],
