Trolls always existed and became an issue, people had trouble ignoring them, hindsight maybe is because so many on here were also in their teens. But for the most part the questions and answers from some of the smartest wrestling fans was great.¬† My favorite memory?...planning and doing a \"Y/A Takeover\". Yes we did Takeovers before NXT lol. Basically a bunch of us, and I mean a BUNCH, would plan to come into the section at the same time and just post lots of great wrestling questions and also answer the questions posted. For wrestling nerds it was great, to me at least it was. So to me that would be my favorite memory of the wrestling section. Edit: The Dragon and Candle in the top 10 list were from this time period and were 2 of the very best at answering wrestling questions with their knowledge. I was at #10 at one short period of time lol..obviously that's not so anymore. Memories...", 3894, "H3nbC71eaa", 1],

	24618 : ["There is very little point in me recommending my favourite places in Vieste, Monopoli, Oristano, Bosa, or Matera if you aren't going to those places.¬† I also know great places in Rome, Naples and Florence.¬† But the good news is that it doesn't really matter. ¬†One thing Italy does really well, almost universally, is really good food. Just try to stick to the back streets away from the obvious tourist traps and you'll eat some of the best food you'll find anywhere on Earth. Forget everything you know about Italian restaurants outside of Italy, because with very few exceptions they are a very pale imitation of the real thing.¬† If you ever can, visit the old town area of Matera. That had absolutely the very best restaurants we've ever eaten at in Italy. Except for maybe the very best Spanish restaurant we've ever been to, which was Hostaria de Don Juan in Monopoli, Italy. Also excellent fish at Osteria del Porto in Savelletri (a few miles south east of Monopoli). Oddly enough, some of the worst pizzas we had in Italy were in Naples: supposed to be the ‚Äúhome‚Äù of pizza. In fact, Naples was the only place we've been to in Italy with lots of disappointing places to eat. It's also a really grubby and run-down city, and some parts of it just didn't feel safe to walk in when we wandered away from the main tourist areas.¬† By the way, if you're coming from the USA, Canada or Australia then bear in mind that European countries are larger than many visitors think.¬† As examples it takes 3h 30m to drive from Monopoli to Vieste. It takes 6h 30m to drive to Piazza Navona in Rome from Vieste. Piazza Navona to Florence is about 4h 30m. From Florence to Venice, it's another 4h 40m, and you will waste lots of extra time on arrival just finding anywhere to park. Even Milan to Genoa which looks like a short hop on the map typically takes about 3h 20m to drive. All those assume no roadworks delays, and that's an unrealistic assumption.", 3908, "gjUpsUZAaa", 0],
