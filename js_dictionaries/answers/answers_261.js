	13062 : ["You didn't say where you're from so I can only give examples from the law where I live, here in the UK. Age discrimination is certainly allowed as long as there is a good reason. Obviously no one demands that adults be allowed to play in a sporting league made for children, for example, and even within those teams you'd still expect to put them into age bands. Similarly a company could offer a special trip deal for 'over 60's', and they're allowed to exclude people in their late 50's by saying the trip has been organised with specific facilities and services for older people on the coach. There are many other examples - perks for seniors, limits on financial services, etc, all legal. So one allowance is \"enabling people of particular age groups to enjoy activities together\", it might be better to not say 'no high schoolers' ('direct discrimination') but instead state it indirectly, say that 'the purpose of the group is to bring together people of the same age range'.", 2176, "None", 1],

At least these days we've got phones and Google to either confirm or deny something.  It's such a rare move in chess and it requires so many things to be in place - but I got so obsessed with it that I made it a priority to do (and remained true to the rules so that the implementation was legit) and I used it a couple times here and there and the other person was simply irate like 'You can't do that! You can't do that!' Royal Flush was another awesome thing.

This is interesting because the methods I've found that help with this problem provide immediate gratification. This is useful for all kinds of things you don't feel like doing. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Or start by just cleaning the kitchen counters. Immediate gratification! Keep working for longer and longer intervals, still taking 5 min breaks. Soon you'll be working for a half hour or more. ", 2192, "oc4ZyRBLaa", 0],

	13099 : ["Is feminism the largest obstacle to achieving gender equality in the U.S.?\" Yes it is. The modern day feminist lobby has for decades now been on a continuous march for gender specific laws that privilege women; most of time while disadvantaging men. This is how a violence against WOMEN act got passed despite the reality that it is MEN, not women who are the primary victims of violence in every society of the world.   Every single law that feminists lobby for advantages women. There is no such gender equal law that they lobby for. And now here's the reality check. All adult women, in the first world today, are fully emancipated, legally autonomous individuals with at least the same legal Rights and Opportunities as every other citizen... including men.   So why do feminists believe that women need special provisions and laws made for them when they are already completely equal at a minimum??   Feminists seem to disrespect all women as a group by insisting that women are incapable of functioning properly in our society while holding only the same Rights and Freedoms. The arguments they make seem to infantilise women ... as if they are children. Can you imagine if we decided to give children full equal Rights and legal autonomy? Then when they proved that they were incapable of making proper decisions, and were too irresponsible to handle their Rights, that a child's' spokesman would insist on more laws to restrict the adults so that the children could do better by handicapping the adults? THIS IS WHAT FEMINISM LOOKS LIKE today.   Feminists seem to imply that women need equal Rights, but then more privileges because they cannot meet men half way with just equal Rights.  .", 2195, "aSm9xSn3aa", 1],
