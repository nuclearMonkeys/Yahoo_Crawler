	86364 : ["KCX, I build match AR's.     The only thing you need to do to insure you can own an AR-15 in the future is to simply purchase an AR-15 stripped lower.  These are bought just like they were a rifle - same paperwork.  You can find some like Superior Arms as low as $95 each or for a name brand like Rock River $145 each.      Once you have all the parts - you will also need the $400 in special tools and somone with 10 years experience to build it.  No doubt you can handle most of this yourself - but - you really want someone with knowledge to install and headspace the barrel plus use a trigger jig to mate the hammer and sear.      That said....... I have never installed a new barrel that did not headspace perfect.  And I have never pulled a trigger and sear from a bin of parts or parts kit that did not function correctly.  Rough trigger - but servicable.  The headspace is mostly peace of mind and required for military personel to do on assembly - a factory defective barrel can hurt somone.      Bottom line - keep the mini-14 as your 'plinker' - buy an AR-15 lower - and start picking up some nice high quality components as time goes on.  In a year or so you should be able to assemble and own a truly great match rifle.   Another considerations once you get the lower - buy 'takeoff's since most people buy a complete AR-15 and then start removing things and adding the new improved versions......... buying these takeoffs is a very, very, inexpensive way to get a stripped lower operational! Hope this helps  ", 9224, "cR7Sf4cjaa", 0],

	86382 : ["My policy is to never trade off perfectly good firearms for any reason. I learned this the hard way. Hang on to those to fine firearms. Instead do this: pick up a copy of \"shotgun news\" at barnes and noble or other book stores. Go thru the ads and find a stripped lower receiver from a quality manufacturer. A good price is as close to $100.00 as possible. Brands like DPMS, Olympic arms, Rock river arms just to name a few, are all good quality. Next, contact a local FFL dealer at one of the gunstores. Have them let you have a signed copy of their FFL so you can send it to the company that you want to buy the lower from. The company will ship it to the dealer you use, and he will charge you right around $25.00 to do the paperwork and you can pick up your lower receiver. BATFE has ruled that this serial numbered lower IS the firearm, and is the only part you need to go thru a licensed dealer for. You can buy all other parts direct. If you own this part before any ban goes into effect, it should be grandfathered in. Then save some money up and instead of buying different parts that may or may not fit right, save up about $475.00 plus shipping and order a complete kit from www.MAPARTSINC.COM  I have built many ar rifles and carbines and have found that they have the best kits out there for a very good price. All of their kits come with the heavy match barrel already attached to the upper, and headspaced and test fired, this alone saves you the cost of having to pay to have it headspaced, and saves you the labor and needing special tools to assemble the upper (you should buy the tools anyway from brownell's just so you have them if needed in the future, but you can buy them at your leisure).

	86392 : ["Oh my goodness --- the prince of preachers and a prophet to boot. What a spiritual legacy you have, you lucky girl! Calvinism is the natural outgrowth of believing in God's sovereignty in my opinion. It is believing that God is ruling the universe and is absolutely in control of everything and that He plans everything. There are about a squillion bible verses to back this up. The part that most people find really hairy about this is that the natural outgrowth of it is that those who get saved were also planned by God, if that makes sense. It is called the doctrine of election (as in, those who get saved were elected or chosen by God). That said, calvinists still believe that people have free will, and that those who choose to believe get saved, those who don't do not. There is absolutely no what to make these two things square in your mind, and I am aware of that. There are a lot of things in scripture that are apparent paradoxes and this is one of them. And if anyone tells you that he can explain to you how God can be in control of things and how man can simultaneously have free will, he is lying to you. No one has ever been able to do it before, no one ever will. Only the mind of Christ can understand this. (It's kind of like the whole Jesus is God/Jesus is man thing ---- and there are lots of other things like this in scripture too, like the trinity) As you obviously know, your great-great-great-great-great-great grandpappy was a big proponent. If you ever get a chance, read some of his sermons. I can't think of *anyone*, literally, who is more eloquent. He's like the Shakespeare of preachin'.

	86393 : ["it is a pleasure to write to you, Charles H Spurgeon was a Presbyterian  preacher in the 1840-1860's if I remember. He was called the prince of preachers, who's main element in preaching was holiness and living for Christ. He maintained that the only way you could do that was to have a good relationship with Jesus through the Holy Spirit. He was a forward looking man who called out the dangers of an emerging attack on the church while it was in its very early years of formation, called, pragmatism. A term meaning do what every it takes to get church members.  Basically it is selling out the gospel of Jesus Christ for the money more members bring in, and the prestige of having the biggest building on the block. He is buried in obscurity there in england,  a giant among men of God, not basically forgotten for his stand againt this emerging heresy noted above. How he would react to knowing his decendants are wiccans and neo-pagans, I would suppose he would say nothing but quietly, and effectually pray for you with every fiber of his being for you to know the LORD as he does. I do not think he would be turning in his grave, grieved, yes, but not troubled. Calvanism is the doctrine, based in the Book of Romans, in which the LORD God is stated to be soveriegn, and he choses who will be saved and who will be damned. The idea is very specific to the doctrine of election, eternal life, and communion and abiding as taught in the bible.  It is exclusionary in that it rejects the brotherhood of man/fatherhood of God as well as eternal life for them that do not believe. if you want to know more, email me, I would like to talk, I think it is cool to have someone famous in your family.

	86398 : ["Oh good lord. NOW you're interested in something you know nothing about, just because it's about to be banned? I hate you, but I'll answer your question anyway, becuase you ARE part of the problem. Which means you're going to have to sit through my long winded description. First, the AK. Designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1946, adopted in 1947 as an assault rifle. By the way, the ACTUAL definition of an Assault Rifle is \"A military rifle of intermediate caliber capable of both semi and fully automatic fire, designed to fill both the role of the submachine gun and battle rifle interchangeably.\" Fast forward about 60 years or so. The AK's ACTION system is considered so reliable, that civies would like to have legal, NON full auto versions of the gun. So AK's are manufactured outside the country to the stringent ATF import standards, with receivers which cannot accommodate the fully automatic parts. They LOOK like the military AK's, but are not, and cannot be made into them without significant machining and modification. But they LOOK exactly the same. They take the same bayonets, they take the same scope mounts, they take the same magazines, and they fire the same ammo. But they are not assault rifles. They are merely rifles. Or carbines, to be exact. But, because they are still in the configuration of the venerable AK, they are still referred to as AK-47's. So in this case, AK-47 is a gun type, even though originally it was a particular model of a particular design. In fact, we drop the 47 and just call it an AK action, because now there are .223 rifles on the AK action (The WASR-3 and AK-101), 5.45 rifles on the AK action (the AK-74), and even SHOTGUNS on the AK action (The Saiga 12). None of them are fully automatic. None could be classified as an assault rifle. Yet they all look similar. What you choose to buy to \"get before the ban\" is probably going to be contingent upon how THEY describe the \"prohibited weapon\" and, like the AWB from 1994, may have little to no bearing upon reality whatsoever. Now, on to the AR-15. Designed by Eugene Stoner while he worked for the Armalite Division of Fairchild Aircraft in the 1960's, AR stood for Armalite Rifle (Not \"Assault Rifle\" or any other made-up designation you may hear or read). Stoner submitted a few designs for the US Military, which didn't adopt the AR at first, so Armalite sold the rights to Colt. And THEN the US Military bought it. Bought it like hotcakes at a boy scout pancake breakfast. But now Colt has the copyrights to the designation \"AR-15\". Originally, the AR-15 was the designation for the assault rifle which became the M16. However, once the M16 was adopted and in full production, Colt used the AR-15 monicker to differentiate between the fully-automatic military assault rifle, the M16, and the SEMI-automatic sporter rifle, the AR-15. That differentiation in nomenclature continues today, with AR-15's being the Title 1, over-the-counter, semi-auto counterparts of the M16. The M16, which, with a change of barrel and fire control parts to conform with a new specification, became the M4 -- same receiver, mostly the same internals, different barrel and different toys up top. But still, at the heart, an M16. However, because Colt owns the trademark designation: \"AR-15\", other makers may not name their rifles this same designation, even though it is pretty much the same gun. But, like \"band-aid\", the AR-15 is basically the earliest and most common name for what has become a type of rifle. Now I'll answer your other questions: Manufacturers: There are no less than 20 manufacturers -- and generally you get what you pay for. Good luck finding one NOW. Should have gotten one earlier before the media spooked the sheeple. Bullet sizes? Your ignorance makes me want to vomit. I recommend the correct ammo for the correct caliber.

	86401 : ["I found this great story exposing Lie after Lie by McSame and Palin: 1. The Myth: McCain and Palin claim to be agents of change. The Truth: In a desperate attempt to revive McCain's \"maverick\" reputation, the McCain campaign is trying to co-opt Obama's slogan. But \"change\" is a tough act to pull off when your record almost exactly matches the current president's. According to a study cited by the Huffington Post, John McCain voted in keeping with the president's positions 100 percent of the time in 2008 and 95 percent in 2007. 2. The Lie: To burnish Palin's rep as a down-to-earth, no-nonsense fighter of government waste, the campaign keeps bringing up the state-owned jet Palin put on eBay. Today McCain stated: \"You know what I enjoyed the most? She took the luxury jet that was acquired by her predecessor and sold it on eBay -- made a profit.\" The Truth: As Politico points out, Palin did put the Alaska-owned plane on eBay. But she failed to sell it. Instead, the state had to go through a private broker to unload the jet and ended up losing money in the transaction. Or, the opposite of profit. 3. Flip-Flop: Offshore Drilling. Original Position: In 1999, McCain made conservatives very unhappy by supporting a moratorium on offshore drilling. Politically Expedient Position: McCain can't afford to make conservatives unhappy anymore; his campaign now depends on the rapturous love of a conservative base that is still suspicious of him from when he used to take intelligent positions. So he switched his position on offshore drilling. As Dana Milbank at the Washington Post writes, McCain recently argued that \"those very same 'moratoria should be lifted' and proposed incentives for the states 'in the form of tangible financial rewards, if the states decide to lift those moratoriums.'\" 4. The Lie: McCain and Palin have said up to 29 times and counting that Palin told Congress \"'thanks but no thanks' on that Bridge to Nowhere.\" The Truth: Palin strongly supported the Bridge to Nowhere and campaigned on the issue while running for governor of Alaska in 2006. It should also be noted that she never actually got the chance to tell Congress \"no thanks,\" as Congress killed off the project, choosing instead to give a lump sum for all of Alaska's transportation projects, money that Palin gladly accepted. 5. The Lie: McCain keeps repeating, over and over and over again, that Obama's tax proposals will hurt the middle class. The Truth: Obama's tax policy cuts taxes for people in the middle-income brackets, while his plan would increase taxes only for those with a family income above $250,000 and individuals who make more than $200,000. Not exactly the middle class.", 9228, "LT7IwZdhaa", 1],
