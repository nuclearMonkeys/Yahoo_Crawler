In my opinion, animals and even plants have life...they only differ in the degree of manifestation of life...like it is most manifested in humans and least in plants. Though plants have life for that matter even stones have lives...but manifestation is very very low...consciousness is not as advanced as in Humans and animals. Animals expereince simlar pain and fear when killed...like humans...they have blood and meat similar to us...there is fine line of difference between a cannibal and a non veg this is the reason for the increased incidences of crimes, murders and killings of humans as people become more insensitive to killings, bloodsheds for they are used to it. if we want to have a peaceful world...we must avoid killing innocent animals to satisfy our taste. What if some superior being starts killing humans for their food...then do't we call them cruel. the same applies when we kill lesser creatures for our pleasure Even from the health angle, nature has provided many vegetarian alrernatives to sustain and grow the body and mind...being a born vegetarian...i am very healthy and even in my family many of our elders have lived a century with a very active and disease free life. even now our grand mother who is 99 and is going good... hope this information helps... Edo: I agree with yoi, according to Hinduism, the eating and dressing habits were designed to suit the varna(profession or occupation) Rama and Krishna were meet eaters since they were Kings and had to be physically strong to protect the kingdom, likesise mannual workers/labour class was also permitted to eat since they have laborious tasks and needed more physical energy.  However the teaching and priest class(Brahmins)-- and Vaishyas(Business class) which involved less of physical and more of intellectual activity abstained from eating non veg since it was not required for their life style or porfession. Abdul: you muslims are fanatics, blindly support your religion...but Hindus support only truth irrespective of who says it...you do not have the audacity to do that", 8760, "K38urtRvaa", 2],

	74170 : ["Short History of Football The American foot ball started in 1879, it is kinda like rugby. The rules were written by Walter Camp. The story football began when a person a soccer team decided to pick up the ball and run with it. The other members of the team found this appealing, and the sport of rugby started. When people got togeter to play rugby, that England , instead of playing with a round shaoed ball, they played with an \" egg- shaped\" ball. This is the short story of the history of football.   Answer In the late 1800s, the game known as football in England was experiencing a split between those who preferred use of the hands in open play and those who didn't. There were other differences, but that was one of the key factors in the creation of the Football Association, which is still the governing body for what Americans call soccer. Teams that preferred a ball-handling game eventually organized under the auspices of the Rugby Football Union. So England ended up with two games called football: association football and rugby football -- known in most of the world as football and rugby, yet they are both \"football\" codes. Meanwhile, American colleges were playing their own version of what they called football -- primarily a kicking game like soccer that allowed more robust hits, like rugby. Every school had its own set of rules, so it was difficult to organize intercollegiate matches. As a result, the first few schools to play \"football\" sat down and agreed to a standard set of rules, which were modeled after the English rugby code. At that point, American football could easily have become known as American rugby, but since players and fans had already been calling the game football, the name stuck. The name, in any event, wasn't so peculiar as we might consider it today, since the game was much more kicking-oriented than it is now. Kicks were allowed from any point on the field (now they're limited to being taken from behind the line of scrimmage); field goals were initially worth more than touchdowns; and since there was no forward pass, teams would often resort to sacrificing possession by punting deep and going on defense, especially if their running game was getting bogged down. So while it might seem odd to modern viewers to refer call a game \"football\" that doesn't primarily employ kicking, there is a legitimate historical reason for it. Also keep in mind that of the world's six major football codes -- association football, rugby union, rugby league, Gaelic football, Australian rules football, and American football -- all of them except association football permit use of the hands in open play, and all of them involve using the foot to a greater or lesser extent to propel the ball. Most of the world refers to American football as \"gridiron\" football, because of all the line markers on the field. That's certainly a better and more inclusive term than \"American football,\" since Canadians play a variety of the same game. \"Gridiron\" can also be used to encompass other variations on the game, such as arena football.", 8763, "0CYasPCoaa", -1],

	74178 : ["American football evolved from the game of rugby.  According to a web page on the history of soccer, rugby was originally called rugby football, and soccer was called association football.  These two sports were considered alternative styles of playing football.  Then in 1863, these two sports finally split and became separate sports.  Since American football is very different from the game of rugby, the term rugby football is no longer accurate.  Therefore Americans dropped the term rugby from their game and called it football instead.  Rugby football was played in the 19th century in America, and American rules were adopted in 1863 as well, so American football is at least as old as rugby.  The forward pass in American football was not legalized until 1906, so for about half a century, American football resemble rugby football in allowing only lateral or backward passes with the hands.", 8763, "None", 1],

	74181 : ["I have been to England, twice.  Spent a lot of time in London, and sat in pubs listening to British Humor.  I didn't understand most of it (I am American) because the jokes related to things that are not in an American's experience level - for example, there was a lot of joking about British politicians - none of whom I knew, so I just didn't understand what the humor was about.  I also noticed that Brit's are very outspoken about politics, so much so, that they wanted me to comment - however, I declined, because it is very poor taste to go to another person's country and make critical remarks about anything. America has pretty much lost its sense of humor, our comedians are very foul mouthed and vulgar, which turns me off.  No amount of foul words can substitute for genuine intellect.  We have too many people in the US that are on their own personal agendas of self-righteousness and so you can't hardly say a thing about anyone in the US anymore without someone getting offended and wanting to sue in court.  It's pretty bad here in the US as a result of that and I wish we could just lock up all the self-righteous do gooders so maybe we all could have a good laugh again. I really enjoyed English breakfast and plowman's lunch with the outstanding cheddar.  I think you Brit's have a lot more dignity and considerably more culture than we do.  Our heritage is from merchants wanting to make money (that is what the American Revolution was really about - merchants and their money).  So we tend to be very materialistic about life, and its awful.  I know Brit's have learned to live with far less and be happy. What we do have in common, is a cultural heritage of law, religion and language and also a sense of the same values in life and moral underpinnings.  We are loosing this due to the vast increase in foreign immigration into the US, both legal and illegal so I am betting in a couple of hundred years, if we are both still around, we will be a lot less similar than we are now. However, I do want to say, I think highly of Britain, feel you are and will always be, our closest ally in the world - yes, we have differences, but nothing we cannot overcome. I really love Queen Elizabeth and I love the historical nature of royalty - I know a lot of Brit's think she is unnecessary, but I'll tell you this much, I couldn't imagine England without Her Magesty!  It wouldn't be Britain any longer.  Think of your long and fascinating history!  I have been watching the series \"The Tudors,\" on TV and I am engrossed.  I am hoping that whatever has come between our two people can be amiably repaired because Britain always will mean a great deal to me, all of you.  I have read all of Sir Winston Churchill's books, studied British History in India, and so many of your famous people, political and military...it's a great tradition you have there.

	74187 : ["Why should one keep borrowing so that bankers can profit from him or her & their children? If I refuse to borrow more money, it just mean I would give up indulging on a lavish or comfortable lifestyle until I get back to it with my savings. In the end no one is going to lend if you keep borrowing without really or can't paying for it, & that's when your property becomes lender's property (repossession & foreclosure). The scheme of paying off debt through borrowing even more by increasing the debt limit thinking that jobs will be created through grants & subsidize cronyism is like some friends, relatives, co-workers, & acquaintance borrowing from one person to another person when they run out of people to borrow from, they use the last person's loan to pay off one of the creditors so that they can borrow even more from that creditor & pay off another creditor's (friend, acquaintance, co-worker, relative) smaller loan to borrow an even larger one while keeping the extra for you're self. Once everyone loose their trust towards them, they disappear where no one can find them. There's a reason why many countries are ticked off or concerned with the dollar. The system of artificially inflating demand (socialism) on certain industries with social benefits or subsidies collapses in the long run. Printing more money is a sneaky way of devaluing what is owed to foreign nations & devaluing future generations earnings, a swindler's method of defrauding & stealing. If trade protectionism can start wars, how about debt. Increasing the deficit 8 times faster or higher than the previous admin for which 3 trillion in 8 years becomes 3 trillion in 1 year & so on doesn't speak much into the admin & DNCs commitment to pay off its creditors loan.
