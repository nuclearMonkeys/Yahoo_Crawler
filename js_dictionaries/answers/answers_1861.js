	98806 : ["I think it fit in all ways but two.  First and foremost the Jews believed in one God.  Some of the statements made by Jesus, according to the Gospels, indicate that He may have been claiming equality with God, so that would be a major issue, to have 2 Gods. Second, there are some prophecies in the OT that the Jews did not see Jesus as fulfilling, leading them to believe he was a false prophet, or of the Devil.", 9672, "None", 0],
	98807 : ["The Jews believe only in the Old Testament, where it is mentioned that Jesus will come, but they believe He must still come. Now, because they crucified Him, they can not allow themselves to believe He was real. This will put them very near to Hell. Even those that do believe He was here, will not admit it, and hope this verses will save them:  Luk 12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

	98819 : ["Jesus' basic message was to love God mightily and love others for God. This coincides with the First Commandment of the Old Testament which was to have no other gods but God our Creator. Jesus said if we lived in love like He said we would be following the law naturally as God willed it. In other words, we wouldn't seek our own will or hurt others. Many of the commandments the Jews followed during Jesus' time were human laws, and not in the Bible. Because Jesus didn't endorse following the human laws, only God's law, some Jews had problem with that. You may find having a personal relationship with God helpful. God is our Creator, all-knowing, all-powerful, eternal, holy, love. God loves us and sent us His Son, Jesus Christ, so we can go to heaven if we know and follow Him. Forever means without end -- time on and on without death. Forever is what happens after we die. Either we go to heaven and be with God forever, or we go to hell which is very bad and painful forever. The good people who are saved believers in Jesus Christ go to heaven. The bad people go to hell. We need to know and follow God in this world to get to heaven in the next world. Jesus Christ, God's Son, is our bridge to God. Jesus died on the cross to cancel our sins. We need to accept Jesus into our life as our Lord and Savior forever to receive God's blessing and forgiveness plus go to heaven to be with God forever after we die. This is about being a born-again Christian. Faith in God is a gift from God. You can pray for faith in God. Just speak out and ask God for the faith to believe in Him and to follow Him. Some people find faith in God when they realize the beauty in the world is made by God. Evolution can't explain the world's natural beauty, for example, the parks in the world, animals, flowers, peacocks, sunsets, butterflies, rainbows, etc. After you have your faith on, you can pray a sinner's prayer to be a born-again Christian. This prayer is very important and should be said with a sincere heart and faith in God. This is the prayer: \"Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for our sins. I have done the following sins (state these out) and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever. In Jesus' name, amen.\" You could find a Christian church and try it out. I'm Lutheran and I like the Baptist churches too. Some churches do a weekly Bible study group and these can be a fun way to make friends and learn about God's will for your life. God bless.", 9672, "None", 0],

	98824 : ["Microgenerators could never deliver 33% of an average households electricity requirements and it would many years to recuperate the initial purchase and installation costs. It would be more economic and easier to re examine and resuce your existing energy footprint. Quite simple things like more insulation in the loft and energy saving light bulbs can make a difference. Alos think hard about buying new white goods. I would not have a dish washer at home and would think hard before ever using an electric fire.  TIP Before switching a light on at home, I look for something to switch off.  I have reduced the bills by approx £25. To conclude microgenerators will only be economic if the government offers big tax incentives, the prive of the units drop and cost of energy increases by significant amounts in the future.", 9677, "e019836b0b25e46c30b02c07fb5c7974aa", 1],

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.   15Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.   16Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.   17Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.   18For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.   19Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.   20For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.   21Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:   22But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.   23Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;   24Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.   25Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.   26Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.   42Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.   43Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.   44But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;   45That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.   46For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?   47And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?   48Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.", 9672, "AA10057370", 0],
