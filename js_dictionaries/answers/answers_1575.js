It was made up  of Japanese Americans, and they were heralded by the army, but not the American citizens. At that time, the Red Cross wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole.  The surprise was he never talked about it and upon his death was it told to me.  He didn't  receive the pomp and circumstance that you saw. How about a four gun salute?

Regardless wether we are Democrat or Republican, for the war or against it, we have to remember that all of these veterans have no choice as to where they are sent.

They closed that section of the site that day and upon exiting the chapel after the church service, I saw the casson with horses outside; the riderless horse with the boots on backwards and damned near passed out! Yes, it is moving yet so DRAINING. I was a mess - a mixture of extreme pride and gratefulness for him and his service to our country through several wars in combat; yet I could barely breathe too. At each entrance/exit along our way to the burial site, there were young men [honor guard] standing at attention and saluting as we passed. When we got to the burial site and sat down and later they did the gun salute, each sound of the rifles tore through me like a knife. Then when they began to remove the casket flag and fold it and brought it to my mom, and she, in turn, handed it to my son, I really lost it. It is a wonderful tribute - yet one that also takes all your resolve to withstand. I just kept reminding myself that this man who withstood racism, bias having enlisted when the service was segregated, yet fought proudly for his country - deserved every minute of that tribute and I felt immensely proud to be his daughter. Some may call this bragging - I call it recognition of a job more than well done...my Dad received 2 silver stars, 2 bronze stars, 3 purple hearts and three Commendation medals for his service during WWII and Korea. Not ONCE during his life did I ever him complain about a daggum thing. He just saw it as his opportunity to 'give back'. Wish he was still here as I miss him tremendously.", 9153, "AA11100707", 3],

The current administration has been antithetical in every regard to the ideals of Libertarianism.  Government has expanded, freedoms have been lost, and the horrible costs incurred through egotistical mismanagement, in both lives and treasure, will be a scar on this nation, internally and from a foreign viewpoint, that will haunt my grandchildren. The Republican party left me a number of years ago, and the Republican candidate left me when he gave the commencement address at Bob Jones University.  McCain-Palin are advocating a theocratic continuation of failed policy, and it's time for a thorough house-cleaning. The label doesn't make the man, his/her actions and word do.  And John McCain is a flip-flopping geriatric case, and Sarah Palin is a naive, red necked rabel-rouser.  For the sake of the country, stop and look at what you're advocating.

I remember I was in grade school when I thought 40 was old. I thought my parents were semi old, and they were around 35.  Forty is still young by most anyones' standards.  But not if the person has been injured in an accident, and can't get around as when they were normal before. I have found that a car wreck can age bones faster and stretch and tear tendons to make any person feel old long before their time.     I once had a friend, who thought for sure he'd die when he hit 40. He was given a big  birthday party with black streamers and things kidding him about dying. Strange, but he did die of cancer when he was around 50.     I'm just one example of how a car wreck can change your life for the worst. Because now I can't stand or walk for long, and it's hard to go up and down stairs, or even kneel since then. So I feel like I'm 70 plus, instead of much younger.      Our daughter was also rear ended and hit her head on her dash board. And now she has had bad migranes and back aches since her 21st birthday, when it happened. So I hope that's a lesson to think about and not be a speed demon on the highways. It takes one accident, to put you out of commission for the rest of your life. And life is no longer fun for anyone, when you are limited in what you can physically do to be active in life.    So enjoy all that life has to offer, while you are relatively young, and are physically able to get out and do things. Tell your friend to stop dwelling on what will happen to him by hitting 40. Tell him instead to concentrate on living and eating right, so that he can live to really be old, by anyones' standards. That's when life gets 'interesting'.", 9159, "XEbrGfZuaa", 2],

I can and will defeat him in 2008. Eric Dondero, Fmr. Senior Aide US Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) 1997-2003  Dondero: In closing let me just say, that I don't believe his views represent the views of Congressional District 14 any more.  The District, which I live in, is quite considerably more Conservative of foreign policy/defense issues than Ron Paul.     The guy didn't even end up running.

Paul: He's a disgruntled former employee who was fired. Reason: But he says he's running because of your debate performance. So is this presidential campaign weakening your standing in your district? Paul: Well, if it affects my standing in my district then I wouldn't be a very good candidate for the presidency. If these views are popular, and I think they're popular enough, then they should be popular in my home district. They've been hearing me saying this for a lot of years and I keep getting re-elected rather easily. I think politicians are always concerned about how they're doing in their district, but right now, if Eric Dondero is the only thing I have to worry about, then I don't have a lot to worry about. Reason: What Dondero's said is that \"there are essentially two Ron Pauls. There's the national liberal media (and libertarian blogosphere) Ron Paul. And then there's the South Texas good hometown doctor, red, white, and blue Ron Paul.\" And he's said you talk a good game about supporting veterans but they don't know your positions. Paul: All one would have to do is go to the veterans part of my website. I win so many awards; we have so many people who call us from around the country because of the work we do for veterans.
