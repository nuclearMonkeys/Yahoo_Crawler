If you have no grades for your last semester of school, it drops your grade average significantly. While there may be one...  I don't know of any universities that accept a GED as an admission criteria.  I don't think your mother would get into trouble unless your explulsion had to do with a crime.  Such as property damage, or something she could be sued for.  However, YOUR entire life will be impacted. You won't have a good education.  You probably won't even go back and GET your GED because most people that are quitters don't.  Without a good education, you will have much difficulty gettting a job where you could even support YOURSELF, let alone hope to marry and have a family someday. So, the way you hurt your mother, is by having to live in her basement for the rest of your life while you ask your customers if they would like fries with that. The mere fact that you would attend school for 11 or 12 years, and then JUST before graduating, do something to prevent you getting your diploma, tells me you are too foolish to be college material anyway.", 10072, "ZDikOxXDaa", 0],

The consequence for you getting expelled before school ends is that you don't graduate high school, you don't get a diploma, you don't get to walk with your class, and your family will be disappointed in you... that you chose to take the easy way out (GED) than working your way through school and earning a diploma.", 10072, "rc1qS6Wkaa", 0],

	108954 : ["I was going to say: (1) what the hell are you doing \"waiting up\" for your BOYFRIEND - until 5 am while pregnant, no less?  That's something parents do [maybe] for their kids, but you are not his mother.  He has the right to stay out as long as he wants to, just like you have the right to shop for as long as you want to or go away for a weekend with your friends if you want to.  He is not a child that needs minding.  He is a grown man.  He doesn't need your permission or approval. (2) Would it have been respectful of him to call you and say \"I'll be a little late, don't worry\" yes, BUT, would it have been respectful of him to wake you up at 2 am to do that?  If you were sound asleep, would you have appreciated being woken up at that hour?  No. (3) Why would you pick a fight with a drunk guy at 5 am?!  That is just asking for trouble. But then, you said you were 16. Which explains everything. YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO BE PLAYING HOUSE.  You are still a KID, immature and without the life skills and experience to deal with situations like this. I am NOT excusing his behaviour.  The fact that he stayed out late is his right - see above - but he should absolutely not be putting his hands on you in any way.  That is abuse and you should have called the police right after you left. Your friend is an idiot and I'm not even going to address her absurd comment.  If you don't see what's wrong with what she said, or if you think she might be right, then you're more immature than I thought. You don't \"love\" him.  Surely you can't love someone who hits you in your sleep?  That is NOT what love is.  Surely you think more of yourself than that you deserve someone like that? Be glad he's not contacting you.  Consider yourself lucky because otherwise you could end up as a statistic.  Move on.  You have a child to think about now and its your job to protect that child AND his mother.", 10074, "NPIGs1pCaa", 0],
