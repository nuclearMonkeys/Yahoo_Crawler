	89665 : ["In my opinion, 3 games is MORE than enough but if you want more ideas - at my baby shower a couple of weeks ago, we did shower gift bingo.  Give everyone a blank bingo card, have them write in what kind of gifts they think mommy will get, as she gets them they scratch it off, the first person to get bingo wins.  I think on bingo we did about 3 winners. Another game we played was celebrity baby photos.  We did this as people walked in, my sister had a board with celebrities photos when they were babies or younger (you could also do photos of current celebrities babies).  People had to guess who the celebrity was.  She had a list of about 15 people it could be. One game that I really loved was having people come up with names for our baby.  We don't know the sex and we have been bad at coming up with names so people had to use my first name and dh's first name along with our last name to come up with names for the baby.  My sister gave everyone 10 minutes, people came up with some pretty good stuff. One game played at a friends shower that I enjoyed was old wives tales.  It listed about 25 old wives tales and people had to guess if it was true for a boy or a girl.  Whoever had the most correct won.", 9333, "tsNkzXapaa", 1],

Big baby shower game hits I know of include: Baby item bingo (print out bingo sheets with different baby items and call out said items like Bingo) Remember what's on a tray of baby items. Take a roll of toilet paper and have the guests pull out as many sheets as they think is the girth of the pregnant woman.  The closest is the winner. If the baby already has a name, then take that full name and see how many words you can make out of it. Nursery Rhyme guessing game.

Who ever is the closest gets a door prize. Good luck and have fun.

I got a neat idea for the cake to be decorated with little spiders and spiderwebs in the corners - - not all over, but just towards the top/corners. We don't have a venue selected yet so centerpieces are still in the idea stage - - if the place offers candelabras we are going with that and will fill in around them with gourds, little pumpkins, bite sized candy and fake fall leaves.  If there are no centerpieces offered I am looking into fake carved jack o' lanterns with those battery-operated fake candles inside and putting the leaves & candy around. Our favors are little ceramic loaf pans (for baking) with halloween designs on them (ghosts, pumpkins, spiders).  We will probably fill with bite-size candy, wrap 'em up in tulle and put a bow with our names/date on it. For music I want the \"Time Warp\" and \"Monster Mash\".
