	115589 : ["Human nature can be vile. Since the fall of Adam man has been sinful (man as in human race, not just the male of the species).  The bible shows us every possibility of what man 'might' do. Nowhere does it say man 'should' do these things. However the laws state what should be done 'if' these things occur. They were very basic ways of making amends, trying to rectify a situation.  In the times to which you refer a woman was the property of her father until she married and then the property of her husband. To rape a girl was to deprive the father of a dowry that he would get when she married. A raped girl would not be marriageable so the rapist had to marry her and pay for the privilege just as any other husband would. These things sound odd and unfair now because times have changed so much but in those days things changed very slowly.", 10425, "xLKPKgZXaa", -6],

Though they may not be needed in the short run for the balance of the ecosystem it may have significance in medicines due to the parasites that it has and also it may have significance in the study of its life. As for stuffed animals they seem to provide comfort for people. For example, when a child is very sick in the hospital, most hospitals will give a stuffed animal.

[the coiled double bun look] next, take your hair and divide it so you have two layers, a top and a bottom, twist your top layer at the back of your head, pin with a bunch of bobby pins. do the same bun with the bottom layer right under the first one. make sure they are touching, otherwise it wont look good! [the side bun] curl your hair all over, they don't have to be perfect. loosen the curls by scrunching them up with ur hands and messing with them. then take your hair and gather it into a kinda messy ponytail where u want your bun to be. spray with hair spray, and after it dries push your curls towards you head and randomly pin around the base of the pony. shape it with the pins into a bun on the side of your head. you can add a cute little clip with a flower on it taddaaaaa finished! if u want anymore ideas just send me an email :)", 10434, "JLzdAt83aa", 0],
