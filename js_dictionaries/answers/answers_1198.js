	65407 : ["\"All Constitutional rights have limits and exceptions\" You clearly don't understand why the Bill of Rights was written in the 1st place. I'll give you a quick history lesson, since it's obvious our schools have failed us. Back when America won the Revolutionary war, they had a group of people (referred to as the Federalist) who saw the need for a powerful central government. They drafted up the Constitution and proposed it to the states for ratification. The opponents of this powerful central government (the anti Federalist), was very concerned to give so much power to the government. So the 2 groups did something unheard of today, they compromised. The anti federalist agreed to ratify the Constitution, as long as the Federalist adopted a list of rights that would protect the citizens from the government. This is how the Bill of Rights originated. They weren't attended to be privileges, they were attended to be security.", 8292, "PMpkEIbhaa", 4],

	65417 : ["\"Firstly, please don't post any anti-feminist comments.\" I think in order to reach him it would be useful to understand and discuss common points of critique against certain branches of today's feminism. \"He says sexual objectification and rape culture are okay\" I don't think many men would ever say that \"rape culture\" is ok. After all rapists are considered to be pretty much the lowest scum on earth, only child rapists are considered worse. Even murderers are less unpopular than rapists. Methinks it's more likely that he says that a certain thing or aspect is life is ok, and you deem that to be rape culture yourself. He likely would disagree that it's rape culture in first instance. \" because men see women sexually due to testosterone.\" There certainly is sexual tension between men and women...i see nothing wrong with that, it makes life exciting and fun. And yes, there certainly is a kind of sexual objectification of women, just like there is financial objectification of men. Just like many men define women based on their looks, many women define men based on their income. I don't see any feminists protesting against the latter. Should they not protest against both if they want *equality*? \"He claims unbalance in jobs is just because women don't want to be in higher jobs- he doesn't understand the background to why this is.  \" Why is it then? Might it be the same reasons that keep women out of particularly dirty jobs such as sewer maintenance? If you truly care about *equality* should you then not also advocate more women in such jobs? Women can and should do the same jobs as men after all, should they not? How about programs that endorse male nurses and male nursery teachers? Yet so far i only ever see feminists complaining about too few women in nice white collar jobs. They don't really seem to be caring about equality. They only ever fight for women's rights and advantages and i never see them fighting for men in places where men are disadvantaged.  These are examples where men are disadvantaged: - The health care system spends more money for female patients than males - Most homeless people are male - Male criminals receive far harsher sentences than female ones who did the same crime. Also, i think that equality does not mean identity.  Men and women should have equal rights and equal opportunities and chances. Whether they use those chances should be up to them, and i don't see it as a problem if some metric reveals that men and women may have different preferences and prefer different pathways and careers. Many feminists don't think so. When they see a metric that says that e.g. 80% of persons in a particular field are males, then they jump to the conclusion that that must be due to discrimination of women in that field. Albeit only if it happens to be an attractive field, if it's not then they are quite silent about it...see the sewer maintenance example.", 8288, "hs2wcZBcaa", 2],
