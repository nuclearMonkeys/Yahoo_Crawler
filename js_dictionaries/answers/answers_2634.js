	137534 : ["CM Punk vs Daniel Bryan. As someone else said, this match would most likely steal the show (right after Jericho/Undertaker, but I'll get to that later). Combine the talents of these two and you are in for a hell of a match. I wish WWE would do away with the brands and make it into one big show again, it opens up so many new possibilities. Some of the lesser talent would have to be weeded out of course, but we can make exceptions.  Rating: 9.5/10. Tag Team Championship match. I like the contenders in this match, but I also think you have got some of them wrong. Hart Dynasty and The Uso's will most likely still be tag teams by the time WrestleMania comes around, but I wouldn't put Swagger and Ziggler together. I just don't see them working together at all and they would probably have no chemistry as a tag team. Chemistry is a very important factor in any successful tag team. As for Zeke Jackson, I think the logical thing to do would be team him with Shad Gaspard. Rating: 6.5/10. Money In The Bank. I'm not certain as to whether they will be a MITB match at WrestleMania now, but I will give my opinion on your match anyway. I think you are correct with everyone you put in the match apart from Barrett and Kingston. These two are primed for the big time and when Nexus break up, I can see Barrett going straight into the WWE Championship scene. He will be the Sheamus of 2010/11. He won't need a MITB briefcase to get him into the spotlight, I don't think. As for Kingston, the same probably applies. Rating: 8/10. Divas Championship. I am glad this match in here, because it would have the potential to be great. We don't see a lot of great Divas matches now, but I think this would be an exception. Both women are tough and have great wrestling skills, I would be high on this match if it happened. Rating: 9/10. Falls Count Anywhere. I can't say I would be particularly interested in this match, The Miz shouldn't be having standard midcard matches, he should be in title matches by the time WrestleMania comes around next year. He is getting the push of his lifetime and I fully expect him to main event WrestleMania this year (more on this later). Rating: 5/10. Street Fight. I like the idea of the Street Fight, but not with the Big Show. I don't think these two would have what it takes to pull of a classic. Sheamus is good Street Fight material, he could talk about being brought up in Ireland where you have to fight on the streets every day to survive or something like that, but Big Show is a no. If anything, I would take Goldberg out of his match with Triple H and put him in this match with Sheamus. Rating: 5/10. Legend vs Legend. Undoubtedly, this would be the GREATEST match of the night. This is a dream match for many and the best thing is, it has a possibility of happening. It is common knowledge now that it will either be Cena vs Taker or Jericho vs Taker and I would take either one. Both would be classics (yes, Cena vs Taker would also be a classic). That's all I have to say on this one, the sheer quality of this match would tell the story better than I ever could. Rating: 10/10. Womens' Championship. I suppose this match would be okay, I'd like to see Beth win this one and have a healthy title reign. It's a shame her last one was cut short by injury. Don't have a lot to say about this one really. Rating: 7/10. World Championship. This match would be on a par with Punk/Bryan and would probably just fall short of the Taker/Jericho match. The history these two have together is incredible, not to mention the chemistry they share in the ring. It would bring an end to a great storyline, dating all the way back to the Attitude Era. This feud is one of the reasons I wish Edge was never drafted to Raw, although he can always go back. Great match, probably an all time classic. Rating: 9.5/10. Goldbergs' One Last Match. I have already said it up there, when talking about the Street Fight, but I honestly think it should be Goldberg vs Sheamus. We have seen Triple H and Goldberg collide already, this would be something new and it would probably end up turning out to be a good match. If they wanted to push Sheamus as a true monster, they could also have him defeat Goldberg. His credibility would go through the roof if that happened. Rating: 6/10. WWE Championship. Orton vs Cena. Where have we heard that before? I honestly think people are tired of seeing this now, we had enough of it in 2009. They would really have to twist things around to make this saga entertaining again, such as turning Cena heel and having Orton as the tweener character that the fans love. It would also have to be a better match than they put on at any other PPV. Rating: 7/10. BQ: Hell yeah, I would definetely watch this WrestleMania.", 11357, "AQKKy14xaa", 0],

	137536 : ["1. I think the winner would be CM Punk . They have two different styles, and I would love to see how they would incorporate them into one . And weren't they both in the indies or something ? Great Match . 9/10 . 2. The winner would be Jack Swagger and Dolph Ziggler . I don't think they will ever be a tag team, but they would definatley beat those excuses for a legacy Hart Dynasty, those dreadful Usos along side the ugly Tamina, and Ezekial Jackson/Drew McIntyre . Jackson is never coming back anyway . 7/10 . 3. John Morrison would pull this one off . I don't think the Nexus will be in the WWE by WrestleMania, so I would eliminate them . That leaves Evan Bourne, R-Truth, Kofi Kingston, Cody Rhodes, Kaval, and Ted Dibiase . Their good, but not enough for Morrison . He needs the push anyway . 8/10 . 4. Melina would be the winner . Natalya does have good talent, one of the few divas in the WWE that have both talent and looks . But Melina is too experienced for her . 7.5/10 . 5. The Miz would win . The Miz is an Edge type guy to me . He gets beat up throughout the whole match, but at the end he finds a sneaky way to win . That's why I'm a big fan of Edge . 8.5/10 . 6. Big Show would win . Sheamus is the most overrated peice of monkey crap I have ever seen . He's been in the business for about 7 months and is already a 2 time WWE Champion . That's a smack in the face to the young talent who deserve it much more than Sheamus . I would want Big Show to knock him out . 8/10 . 7. I love Chris Jericho (as a wrestler of course) but the streak of the Undertaker will never end . That's what he's most known for . 10/10 . 8. Beth Pheonix would win . She's another one of the few divas that have talent and good looks . Layla can't wrestle for her life, and Michelle McCool is an alright wrestler . But I would give this to Beth . 7.5/10 . 9. I hope Christian would win . He deserves it now more than anybody in the WWE . And make this match a TLC Match ? This would have to be my favorite . In favor of Christian . 10/10 . 10. Well, I would say Triple H since he's my favorite wrestler currently, but its Goldberg's last match . And that would suck to see Goldberg leave on a negative boom like that . But good match though . 9/10 . 11. The winner would have to be John Cena . I'm not a fan of Randy Orton, the King of Krazy . The guy gets hype after a freaking punch like please calm down . And plus, Cena is the face of the WWE, who wouldn't want to see him win ? 8.5/10 . Best Match: Chris Jericho vs. Undertaker . Worst Match: Melina vs. Natayla .

	137537 : ["I think I can admire you spending so much time typing all of that out, and spending the time to think it all up.  That being said it pains me to side with an Obama supporter. But he's right your card is terrible, and Christian is NEVER going to get a push in WWE. That's just how it is, the sooner all of the Christian marks out there figure it out the better off you all will be. It's not like I hate Christian it's just simple facts. IF he was ever going to get a push it would of been when he came back to WWE this last time. He should of been placed on Smackdown in a feud with Edge. (Well that was the case until all the wrestling dirtsheet websites ruined it, and WWE changed their mind.) Anyway, he's not going to be getting any push in WWE. He's stuck on the mid-card and that's where he's going to stay for awhile. Back to match card. Sure there are a few good matches on it, but the placement is all wrong, and you have some downright terrible matches on there. NO ONE would actually pay to watch Sheamus(although I like him a lot) vs. Big Show. Goldberg while intriguing the average WWE fan these days don't even know who he is, and if they did they don't care about him anymore. Orton vs Cena....might happen you're right, but it would be the most boring match. The both do literally the same couple moves every match. IMO there both garbage. The tag match would probably suck the big one. Rey Mysterio vs Miz (seriously) GARBAGE. MITB is ok, but you should replace Darren Young with Justin Gabriel. The special event night of legends....isn't that what the HOF ceremony is every year?  You did get a couple of things right though.... CM Punk vs. Bryan Danielson would absolutely steal the show(no matter what the card, but especially this card). That's why it needs to be in the middle of the PPV, not the beginning. Jericho vs. Undertaker...it would be a great match without a doubt. But the messed up thing about Undertaker matches at Wrestlemania is you already know who is going to win, so it takes away from it IMO. It would be a classic, and historical moment if Jericho could make Undertaker tap out to end the streak. Now that would be great, but if Undertaker was going to end the streak it would of happened to Shawn Michaels and no one else. The announce team....well you hit that on the head, it can't get any better than that IMO. Overall, could be a good show IF those couple of matches and the announce team make up for all the garbage you packed it with.", 11357, "MPoL8sZgaa", 2],
	137538 : ["1st Singles Match CM Punk vs Daniel Bryan 7/10: I like the idea of the match, it just has to mean something.  I know a lot of indy fanboys will pop one off to this, but unless you're one of them, this isn't going to really make much sense.  Toss in a title and I'll be happy...IC, perhaps?  Good card opener. 2nd Tag Team Championship (Fatal 4-Way) The Hart Dynasty (c) vs The Uso Brothers vs Ezekiel Jackson & Drew McIntyre vs Jack Swagger & Dolph Ziggler 6/10: I like big tag bouts, and I even like the idea of Zig-Swag as a tandem, but Zeke and Drew doesn't make sense yet.  The titles would definitely benefit from this type of bout.  I think the crowd would be pretty hot for this bout too. 3rd Money In The Bank Evan Bourne vs John Morrison vs Wade Barret vs Kofi Kingston vs Cody Rhodes vs Ted DiBiase Jr vs Kaval vs R-Truth vs Darren Young 9/10.  This is a good MitB lineup.  I would have put it after the Diva's bout, considering you have 3 crowd heaters in a row and then a woman's match.  I'm not doubting the credibility of either woman involved, but female wrestling has that bathroom break stigma about it. 4th Divas Championship  Melina (c) vs Natalya 4/10  It could be a good woman's bout, but I just think the placement kills it.   5th Anywhere Falls Rey Mysterio vs The Miz 6/10  I don't know how well Miz and Rey would work together, so that's a factor.  I'm also not fond of so many gimmicks in one PPV, and considering the next gimmick is essentially the same thing, you're definitely Russoing it a bit. 6th Street Fight Sheamus vs Big Show 3/10  I think Sheamus and Show could make an OK crowd cooling bout with this, but it wouldn't be phenomenal.  I'd half rather like to see them go at it toe to toe without gimmick because they're both good big men.  Once again, considering the prior Falls Count Anywhere, a Streetfight's redundant. 7th Legend vs Legend Chris Jericho vs Undertaker 6/10  While I think Jericho's awesome, and will go down in the books for it, I don't consider him a legend yet, and I think it would be a great program if he started proclaiming himself one only to get answered by the deadman.  It could be a good short match, but I don't see it going long as I've said before. 8th Women's Championship (Triple Threat Match) Michelle McCool (c) vs Beth Phoenix vs Layla 6/10  It's a good crowd cooling bout, but I don't think there should be more than one woman's title bout on Wrestlemania. 9th World Heavyweight Championship Edge (c) vs Christian (2011 Royal Rumble Winner) 10/10  It books itself, so I'd love to see it.  They have chemistry and history. Special Event Night of Legends (Master of Ceremony: Vince McMahon) Guest Stars: Shawn Michaels, Stone Cold, Ricky Steamboat, Roddy Piper, Bret Hart, Lex Luger, Diamond Dallas Page, Sgt. Slaughter, Big Van Vader, Scott Steiner, Lita, and Trish Stratus. 8/10  Interesting concept.  My only drawback is bringing Shawn back for anything so soon.  Plus, I'm sure Steiner and DDP aren't in a rush to go back to Vince. 10th Goldberg's One Last Match Triple H vs Goldberg 8/10  With the right hype and ring work, it could be a good bout. Main Event WWE Championship Randy Orton vs John Cena (c) 8/10  I've defended it before, and I stand by it.  I agree there's a bit of redundency in it, but it would still be good.  Besides, Rock/Austin headlined three manias in a row back in the day and nobody flinched. Excluding MitB, I think E&C would be the best bout of the night.

	137544 : ["It's a cool review because it's negative. It's always cooler to hate than to jock ride, especially on the internet. However, Ziggler and Bryanson was an awesome match that several counters, near falls, impact moves and hot crowd. Give these guys credit, they did not have a storyline, or even worked together before and to steal the show is something where credit is due. Tag Titles, honestly this Raw GM has been fair to heels and faces alike, you gotta respect that.  Anybody think that Otunga and CENA was challenging tonight is lying.  And now where do we go from here... Cena now is a Champion with a Nexus member, the seeds for the heel turn continue. And hopefully Rhodes can keep up with a plethora of heels on Smackdown and McIntyre can jump in a three feud with Swagger and Edge. Layla gets better every match she's in. What a submission hold on Natalya! By gosh can she be any sexier. Kane and Undertaker absolutely nothing but kicking and punching but what were you expecting hurricanaranas and Canadian Destroyers?  No all you really wanted to see in this match was the conclusion.  And the Undertaker Buried Alive October 24th, 2010 was a nice touch. Good to see the last two remaining were part of the Smackdown Six.  Maybe they'll team up and start it up again.  They had to protect Sheamus so taking him out with the Big Show seem like the right call. But talk about Dominated, Smackdown won the battle royal, the blanked them in the head to head match on Smackdown and beat them at the PPV.  It's like the Federer and Roddick out there. Orton winning because damnit he has too, Nexus doesn't need the belt, they got Cena. Cena's a tag team champion and is doing the right thing.  He beginning to bend the rules without breaking them, it's like a vampire that taste blood, though he doesn't like it, he is still being successful.  All in all, storyline advancement 8 (Nexus, Taker, Smackdown Dominates), wrestling 8 (Bryanson and Ziggler, Smackdown Dominates), entertainment 9 (anytime Layla is wrestling, Cena's decision, Cena and Otunga, hold for hold, counter for counter Ziggler and Bryanson, Taker Buried Alive 10-24, and SMACKDOWN DOMINATES) I say 8.5 But I'm an optimist", 11357, "Pvgzw1bIaa", 0],

I do agree, maybe they should just drop Bragging Rights. It doesn't have a point and it's too similiar to Survivor Series. They should drop BR and keep SS because it is the classic PPV.  One thing I thought was done poorly is the whole Mainevent is about \"will Cena betray Barrett???\" Um... Randy Orton is the freaking WWE Champion and they are acting like Cena is. This isn't me talking as a Orton fan... it just doesn't make sense. The WWE Champions should ALWAYS be involved in a rivalry, but instead he is playing on the side of something else... it doesn't make sense at all. Can you imagine if there whole Undertaker vs. Kane thing was focused on the relationship between Bearer and Kane... and ignored the Undertaker???  If they are going to continue with Cena/Nexus thing, then take Cena and the Nexus away from the title and have Miz cash in on Orton. At least then there can be Miz vs. Orton. It doesn't even make sense when for a WWE title match (Orton vs. Barrett), we actually see a promo of Barret vs. Cena before it... it's absolute rubbish. Why is Randy Orton even WWE Champion when he's not really doing anything? They should just find another #1 contender now.... most likely choice would be the Miz... and move on.
