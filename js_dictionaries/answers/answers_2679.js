	139795 : ["Good question.  The answer lies in the meaning of a Greek word, \"tetelestai\" found in John 19:30.  It is usually translated, \"it is finished.\" \"Tetelestai\" means something fully completed, paid up in full, no longer having any outstanding debt.  It was used in reference to bills having been paid.  It occurs only in John 19, nowhere else in the Bible. But the best scripture would be 1st John 2:2--\"He is our propitiation for our sins, and not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole world.\"  Here the Greek word \"hilasmos\" is translated as \"propitiation,\" meaning a complete satisfaction of a debt.

If there were any photos then it must being a rumor that has being spread maybe started by triple h but i'm not in favor for vicki and don't care what happens but maybe some laughs when she sign up for WWE she pretty much knew what was coming to her cause she is related to previous wrestlers in the past and was well aware of what would happen and yes my sis and i are watching right now", 11439, "rcXH9ylvaa", -1],

Edge should not change his theme song! I love his theme song!  Mvp - Yes he does, it's quite annoying Also I think Jack Swagger should change his theme because his theme song makes him look like a joke when he comes through his entrance. And R-Truth needs to change his theme song, again because it sucks ,,,I prefer the other one more because it's more catchy and I like the other one.

	139808 : ["Paulo is correct.  Beeswax melts at a lower temperature, and isn't as likely to burn you in the process.  Also, don't use scented or colored candles, as the additives increase the temperature that the wax melts at, causing it to be hotter when it melts.  As said before, keep the candle high above the skin, as the wax cools as it falls through the air before making contact with the skin. As with the first post, I could go on for hours about the sensations created during any type of BDSM play, but my expertise is in spanking, not hot wax.

I'm told it kinda spice things up a little and it can't be too hard or too soft. its kind of a light but firm tap on the *** while engaging in sex. some people like to bite, like to fight, it depends on what turn you on and how you like it. try it one day!", 11442, "5SbyyiyGaa", 2],
	139812 : ["For me, I like it to hurt. There's a certain degree of pain that I find pleasurable. When you are already aroused and someone gives you just the right kind of pain, whether a slap or a pinch or even the use of candlewax like you asked before, it heightens everything. The mixture of sensations is almost intoxicatingly orgasmic.  Not everyone enjoys spanking or any form of \"pain\"... so if you experiment with this, start gently as you don't know where your limits/thresholds are. The trick is not avoiding pain, the trick is reading your partner's reactions and gauging what they need. And then giving it to them.", 11442, "9YlQ5HEhaa", 6],
