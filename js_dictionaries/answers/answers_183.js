It may never be the same again but that does not mean it is in danger. There is no shortage of idiots pontificating on Youtube and elsewhere. Other idiots pay attention to them, leading to a spread of idiocy. We do not have to be part of that decline in collective mental ability. Of course Brexit has not happened. No one can agree what it means and what sort of post-Brexit arrangement we want or can get.  Any fool can say 'Let's get out', and a small majority did.  What they never knew was what it really means or how it will affect prices, jobs, security, benefits, food supplies, staffing of our hospitals or the value of the money in their pocket.  Now they should have a better idea.  Now we have a few hundred thousand voters who were too young to vote last time and now want a say about their future. Now we have a few hundred thousand less old people who voted last time but have since died so won't be affected by Brexit. A lot has changed since the Brexit referendum. A second vote should be taken to confirm that the UK still wants to leave the EU and, if so, on what terms.  The trouble is, we have dumbed-down so much as a nation, it is virtually impossible to frame the questions for a second vote in a way most people would understand. What I think of life of times in the UK currently is that it is embarrassing.  Our politicians are embarrassing. Knife carrying by our young people is embarrassing.  The folly of people voting for Brexit by a small majority without knowing its implications is embarrassing.  Our collective attitude to friends and neighbours in Europe is embarrassing (even if the conduct of the EU was and remains embarrassing at times too). The dumbing down of society in general is embarrassing.  Our poor work ethic and low productivity is embarrassing and does not auger well for our success outside the EU. Brexit risks turning us into a little, isolated, powerless, irrelevant, third-world country. That is embarrassing.", 1491, "gYPV2W02aa", 2],
