	55225 : ["The best test in its own right is a Randomised Double Blind Trial. Randomly split the test subjects into two groups, A and B. One group gets the treatment and the other gets a placebo that is superficially indistinguishable from the treatment. Neither the subjects or the experimenters know which group gets the treatment and which gets the placebo.    This obviously requires working with a third party who can independently choose which group gets the treatment and distribute the treatments and placebos. The statistical analysis is done on the results of A versus B and only at the end do the experimenters find out which group was assigned the proper treatment. This supposedly removes experimenter bias. There is a possible placebo effect  present but because the two groups have the same experience the statistics show differences extra to the placebo effect.    For even better results there can be another group that gets no treatment (all groups have the same symptoms). This isn't strictly needed but it helps quantify the actual placebo effect which can be rather sobering - sometimes the placebo effect of being being treated at all is quite big (ie taking a placebo or the proper treatment) and the proper treatment only makes a small improvement above that.", 7699, "jB2Z6uxhaa", 1],
	55226 : ["I don't think it could ever be a purely scientific experiment because not all colds are the same, not everyone is affected in the same way by a cold, and you cannot know for sure that the Hibiscus tea was the deciding factor in any one instance. For example, one subject may have had more sleep than the others, or may have consumed more vitamin C than the others which may have helped them to get better more quickly, leading you to conclude (erroneously) that the tea has made the difference", 7699, "MJADYWwBaa", 2],

	55264 : ["There's a probability-based argument that we are not in our infancy, but that space exploration will soon cease.  If humans were going to go out and colonise the Galaxy, the chances of being born before that happens are vanishingly small, so the fact that we are living now strongly suggests that we will never visit or settle anywhere trans lunar.", 7709, "0GPMDJYKaa", 0],
	55265 : ["What evidence is there that there is significantly more to \"space exploration\" than what we already have? No other species on Earth does more than we do, and no other species elsewhere in the universe (assuming they exist ) shows any evidence of having it. Remember: all the fancy ideas that you have about \"space exploration\" were no doubt derived from fiction such as Star Trek, Star Wars, and old Flash Gordon movies. Fiction is no guide to reality. The notion that \"we are in our infancy\" is just a cultural assumption with no evidence to support it. It is entirely probable that all the technology that we have which is relevant to space exploration is all that there is. And the high opinion that space enthusiasts have about their hobby is really just typical of any fanatical pursuit. Bird watchers no doubt think that bird watching is the most important thing in the world and we should be spending more money on it. Same with railway enthusiasts, ship enthusiasts, home builders, politicians, etc.  Actually it is hard to think of something LESS relevant to the needs of human civilization, and indeed all life on Earth than space exploration. But one thing that is noticeable about the space community is that we are TOLD that it is oh so important, and because we are associated with it, we are supposed to feel special. Always be wary of those who tell you you are important, or who imply it.  At this late stage of civilization, we must make the preservation of the biosphere on Earth our first priority if humanity is going to have any kind of future. Time is running out. The global economy is already deep in debt, and it is only a matter of time before the financial edifice collapses. One sure way to speed up the collapse is to put the global economy into even more unproductive debt. An increase of spending on sending tin cans with people in them up into outer space at a trillion dollars a pop is the way to finally \"break the camel's back\". I think if you broadened your horizons and got out of the space rut you wil find that there are far more things going on to be upset about than whether we go up into space  or not. I would suggest learning about ecology, the incredible biodiversity on Earth and how it is shrinking fast, history both ancient and modern will warn you of the lessons we have failed to learn, a quick course in psychology, chemistry, biology, economics and physics would be a worthwhile way to broaden your knowledge base. We lived without space exploration for hundreds of thousands of years. There is little if any evidence that we are happier today because of it. It is only one out of a great many fields of discovery and adventure, many of which do indeed still have a long way to go. Try not to obsess over space to the exclusion of all else.", 7709, "bXMPytYEaa", -3],
