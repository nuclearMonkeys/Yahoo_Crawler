	91094 : ["HIGHLY recommend (as a dog nutritionist) raw chicken or beef (with bones and organs),Green tripe, alfalfa powder, papaya/cucumber, acidophilus or another probiotic.This is the best your dog can get, natural, healthy, flavorful and very good for dogs with dental problems. Ever since Zodi (my dog) was started on the diet, he has been free of any health problems (fleas, hotspots, worms, infections ect). If you worry about parasites/bacteria, dogs can handle these, they have been fine for thousands of years on this diet. Commercial (canned/dry kibbles) pet food has only been around for 60 years, and how did the dogs survive before these? Raw meat and scraps. So if they were fine then, they will be fine now. Commercial pet food causes VERY bad reactions in dogs because most of them have preservatives that have been banned in people food because they caused tumors, birth defects, allergies, liver/heart failures and other bad things.. Some of them even have euthanized animals (even pets!) in them (\"meat by-products\", \"meat and bone meal\", \"meat meal\"). Corn, which is a main ingredient in most pet foods, is an allergy trigger in many cats and dogs and is not needed. It is used as a cheap filler. Many vets are inexperienced with animal nutrition, and will recommend the wrong food. Sometimes they are ever bribed to recommend pet foods. But on with feeding raw. This diet is about 70% meat and bones and the rest is organs, vegetables, fruits, oils and vitamins. Do not bother adding grain or dairy, for dogs do not need these and cannot use them. For energy dogs use fats from animals. If you worry about exact nutrition, please don't, when you make dinner for you or your family you don't say \"I need Xcups salad, Xcups beef, Xcups beans and three multi-vitamin supplements.\" so why stress about your dog? As said earlier, before commercial pet food, no one fed a strict diet, and ther dogs were fine. So dont worry Also, heres a list of BAD pet food: Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Science/Prescription Diet, Alpo, etc Here are some more recipes:. Chicken Dinner (for a 30-40 lb dog) 1 pound chicken (with bone) 1 egg 1/2 cup vegetables vitamin supplement Beef and Sardine 1/2 pound beef (with bone) 2 fresh wild sardines 1 carrot 1 banana or apple Lamb Breakfast Lamb necks 1 tomato 1 egg Hope it helped, if you have any other questions about nutrition or health id be happy to answer. ˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙Read this part!˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙˙ ˚˚∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆∆˚˚ If you can find a variety of food without potato,that would be quite beneficial to his skin. The cold environment may be the cause of his flaky skin. Also, a bit of raw egg here and there, and maybe some raw carrots will help. Also, here are other things that might help: EQyss ( I think it is called that) a special shampoo/ rub 4 dry skin dogs, coconut oil (a little in the food or on the coat), raw prepared food (natures variety, primal pet food, grass fed traditions, raw diet USA, aunt jeni's etc), brushing every day can help natural oils flow, Dr. Harveys vitamin supplement (the one with bee pollen and spirulina as the fist two ingredients), Show stopper(animal naturals, vitamin), missing link (vitamin), GREEN tripe (rawdietusa.com or tripett/mericks/solid gold tripe), grapeseed/salmon/ cod liver/ flax seed oil can really help, half a clove of garlic every other day, apple cider vinegar (apple cider vinegar can either be applied straight or diluted 50/50 with water can be applied directly to the ichy area.  It will eliminate dandruff and rejuvenate hair) and oatmeal wash, grain free diet (grain is the leading allergy causing thing for dogs, Virbac KetoChlor shampoo (really helps my dogs) and some raw chicken fat (when preparing dinner 4 your self, you cat trim the fat or bone and give it to your dog [raw bones do not splinter,although cooking bones drys out the marrow and reduces moisture content, making the bone brittle and sharp. Chicken necks, or turkey for larger dogs, are considered softer. same with backs and wings. There are many more cases of dogs choking and dying on kibble than bone] the omegas and nutrients are healthful for your dog.). Also keep in mind it may be a more serious problem like  a problem absorbing nutrients, a kidney or pancreas problem, or even a liver problem. Make sure the dog is getting enough vitamin E and A. Hope your dog feels alot better!!    PS. Remember, NEVER EVER feed RAW salmon. Other raw fish is fine, but raw salmon carries a (harmless) fluke. The fluke then becomes a host for a rickettsia bacteria and the bacteria can kill dogs. Salmon oil is fine.", 9383, "0UHLDftmaa", 0],
	91095 : ["You forgot to mention that the team that produced this study also emailed thousands of the scientists who published the studies and got their input on what exactly the studies meant. The total did not include just the abstracts. \"As an independent test of the measured consensus, we also emailed over 8,500 authors and asked them to rate their own papers using our same categories.  The most appropriate expert to rate the level of endorsement of a published paper is the author of the paper, after all.  We received responses from 1,200 scientists who rated a total of over 2,100 papers. Unlike our team's ratings that only considered the summary of each paper presented in the abstract, the scientists considered the entire paper in the self-ratings.\" Here is a link to the page on skepticalscience.com which also has a link to the full study. Maxx: I'd like you to do a test. I'm fairly certain that, despite your disbelief in evolution, hopefully, that you agree that the majority of scientists acknowledge it to be the truth. If you did a study in evolution papers over the past 20 years or so do you actually think that they would state in their abstracts that evolution was a definite? How about gravity? Do you think that every scientific assessment on gravity would explicitly state that gravity was real in it's abstract? It's commonly accepted it is. It does not need to be stated in every single abstract that it is real. Also, the site you linked to is using stats to tell tales. If I take the extremes of both I get 64 that acknowledge AGW and 9 that do not. If I look at the second category of each I get 15 that do not and 906 that do. This is using the search terms 'global climate change' and 'global warming' just as the study did. The time periods are between 1991 and 2011 for each. The abstracts for number 2 consist of \"explicitly endorses but does not quantify or minimize\" and \"Explicitly minimizes/rejects AGW but does not quantify\" The two extremes being the quantities being less or more than 50%. Basically the different categories of the study do not show how much global warming there is. Only the two extreme views have in their abstracts that notion. The end of the article you posted states \"The “consensus” they're promoting says it is more likely humans have a negligible impact on the planet's warming than a large one.\" which is false and not based on any sort of logic at all based on the criteria used. Also, if you look at the actual study, the most popular category was number 3 which is not an explicit endorsement of human caused climate change but does state that an increase of greenhouse gases are causing it. something that goes specifically against what you have been arguing. If we look at the example given '...carbon sequestration in soil is important for mitigating global climate change' we see what is meant.", 9381, "GnvJ1uKsaa", 5],

The term global warming is basically misleading. It is really called global climate change and it all has to do with ocean currents. As ice melts in the arctic ocean currents will be diverted causing europe to freeze. Look at a map, Europe is farther north than Maine. The only reason it is pleasent now is because of the gulf stream that brings warm water and air to Europe. This current will be altered by rising seas and melting ice causing Europe to cool. Texas will experience similar effects. warming and cooling are directly related. Climate change in general is what we will see, not just warming.
