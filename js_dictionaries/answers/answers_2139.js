	112740 : ["Yes, it is possible for a spirit to suddenly start its' haunting after having a tree removed. The spirit was probably awakened, you can try looking for a grave around here. It should help to ask or find out on your own who the spirit is. Usually when someone has a haunting it is best to find out who the spirit(s) is/are. After that you can try to do a cleaning on your own or call in a priest. If you are jewish, christian, or catholic then call in the priest or rabbi or whatever. If you are spiritual, wiccan, or scientific I suggest candles, a bible, and a pentogram/cross. If you want to know how too do a cleansing by yourself you are free to ask me whenever, I am open at all times. Good luck!", 10325, "None", 0],

	112742 : ["Yes. Sometimes spirits are attached to objects. If you bought an old chest from a garage/estate sale a spirit was attached to it would now be in your home. This reigns true when homeowners begin renovations on older homes. The spirits, Intelligent or residual, know the surrounding and most likely will react. But this doesn't mean they are Intelligent, there are 4 types of haunts they could fall under. Maybe someone used to live in that home and spent a lot of time under or around the tree.

Next time you see her with your pony, i know it may sound rude but its not, tell her not to touch your pony, let alone tack her up and ride her. She cant tell you what to do. As long as there arent schedules at the yard you should be able to ride her whenever you want. Look for local riding trails. This is serious. You are not fat, you are a good weight, your pony can carry you fine. DO NOT SELL HER. Like someone said, you will regret it. Try telling her that you own her. Lunging wont damage her at all anybody can do it, you don't need any special skill at all, you shouldnt let her lunge her or use her like she owns her. She is jealous, she wants her, she probably thinks shes very talented, why else would she use her, and make you feel awful? Move her if all fails, only choice left. If it is too expensive at another yard, try offering to help around there to lower the price a bit. Try hiring an instructor who could come to your yard to give you lessons and tell them the story and see what they say, the must be very experienced! Good luck :)", 10327, "None", 0],
	112757 : ["5'5 is not that tall; it's just about average for a female.  At 14, you're not likely to grow more than another inch or two, if that.  And 8 stone??  I WISH I still weighed only that.  Don't worry; you are neither too tall nor too heavy for her, so don't even THINK of selling her if you love her and believe she's suitable for your present level of riding. This barn owner/instructor has serious issues, and I'm dismayed your parents didn't stand up for you.  (If anyone spoke to my 15-year-old step son that way in my hearing it would be the LAST time she did so!)  First and foremost, your parents need to grow a spine and tell her off for the insulting way she treats you.  They need to remind her that she's YOUR pony, not hers, and that THEY are paying for the pony's upkeep.  She's NOT entitled to use her or allow one of her students to use her without your permission, and there's no earthly reason you shouldn't be able to ride or lunge her when and however you wish, so long as you are complying with the stable's rules, and not doing anything that would endanger anyone else. Second, stop doing everyone else's barn chores.  Do your own, whatever's required for your pony.  Make sure you keep her stall neat, feed, groom, and exercise her on a regular schedule, never run out of any supplies you are obligated to provide for her, and be sure to be current on your finances; that way' she's got no cause to complain. Third, you've said she's the only instructor, but do you have to take instruction from her?  Would you be allowed to hire your own instructor?  I think you should. Finally, I do think you should leave that barn.  Keep looking; there HAVE to be other options.", 10327, "RwyLgAHdaa", 3],

	112769 : ["A spirit is a person without a body. they live side by side with us most of the time without us ever knowing about it. Imagine someone coming into you residence after youve lived their for a few hundred years, or it was a very special family property and removed, remodeled, or rearranged things. It would be quite upsetting especially being without a body and unable to prevent it or voice their feelings. These spirits have CHOSE to stay at a location (intead of passing on to where ever) because of their strong connection and comfortability with it, so imagine how shocking it must be to them. My guess is this is their way of trying to get themselves hear the only way they can, and maybe even strike some fear into you so you don't change anything else in the future. They can only communicate in so many ways. They can hear and see you and still retain the same emotions as when they were alive. I have been thruogh a very similare experience and my research taught me what I will tell you. This worked for me. tell your aunt they are fully capable of seeing and hearing you, so I would talk to them, appologize for removing their tree. Explain you didn't know they were there to begin with and you understand it has upset them and this was never your intention.  Also explain that these dreams have frightened you and family members and you would appreciate it if they didn't do it anymore. They experience sympathy and empethy as well as you or I do and are not malicious, just frustrated and panicing. Most humans aren't cruel, so neither are most spirits. Remember you are talking to a person without a body who is trying their best to communicate with you, so do not be rude as rudeness angers anybody and can then cause conflict. Also let them know that this is your house now but you will extend them the curtosy of prewarning them of any other major changes that will be made to the property. They just want to be heard, so let them know you do and it should stop.", 10325, "7rRJAGyFaa", -3],
	112770 : ["If you live in zone 5 or south, (low temps not below say..-10 or -15): Canadian Redbud (cercis canadensis): beautiful rose colored buds to deep pink blooms, (May),then heart shaped leaves.  Dark wood. Usually reaches around 20'. Flowering Dogwood (cornus florida): beautiful bracts in creamy white or pink,(\"bloom\" is April/May)  lots of horizontal branching with an open form and height of around 25 - 30'.  This can be artfully pruned. Korean Dogwood (cornus kousa), similar to the above but somewhat more exaggerated horizontal branching and slightly different bloom time (May/June), blooms are off-white.   Apple (malus domestica) classic and pretty in a sunny location with good drainage.  Crab apple trees are nice and some have fragrance.  Dwarf/semi dwarf trees can be 6-8', and classic crabapples are usually around 20' high. Fringe Tree (chionathus) 12-20' high.  Blooms white \"fringe\" in May/June, nice fragrance, and leaves turn golden in fall.  This is pretty and different.  But it doesn't always bloom right away unless you get one that is already 3 year old nursery stock or better.  For best look a single trunk is nicest.  It is hardy to zone 4. Star Magnolia (magnolia stellata) 15-20' high, blooms May/June, fragrant and double.  Hardy to zone 4, but sometimes blooms are nipped by frost. Oriental Cherry (prunus sp) Kwanzan nice tree with a pretty color, 20' high, but somewhat short-lived.  The life span is usually 20 years or so. June Berry (amelanchier laevis or a. arborea)  pretty native tree with white blooms early April/Mid April.  This is really an all-season beauty with nice fall color.  15-20' high. Stewartia (pseudodcamellia)  This is a beauty and blooms later, in July usually.  It reaches 20-near 30'.  Pretty bark that is reddish and nice glossy foliage.  The fall color of the tree is pretty red-orange or sometimes a bit maroon. Those would be my top choices for zone 5 on south. Without knowing your geographic location, its hard to choose.  But, look those up online, usually by the latin name. Have a good time.  Thanks for planting a tree!  Its nice for all of us! Sometimes Home Depot or even, dread, WM have these trees.  But check to be sure that they are not stressed out, (yellowed leaves, suckers at base, root-bound-in-pot, insects).
