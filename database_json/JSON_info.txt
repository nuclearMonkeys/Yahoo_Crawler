This directory is the data that search_linker.js uses.
It contains the questions and answers (q&a) crawled from
Yahoo Answers prior to its shutdown on May 4th, 2021.
This data possibly contains inapproriate/offensive q&as from
various users. The creators of this project have no original
q&as submitted to the site. We merely created a search engine
for the data we've crawled.

With that said, we want users to report to us q&as that are
overly insensitive that it shouldn't be allowed on the database.
We will then evaluate the data submitted and judge whether or
not to get rid of it. We will do this with minimal censorship so
the data in question will have to be something that violates terms
& services on Github (i.e. hate speech). Simple expression of opinions 
does not count.
