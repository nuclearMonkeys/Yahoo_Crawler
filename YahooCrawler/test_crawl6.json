This has been a huge problem on this site and these three people harasses people and they have done this to one user years ago. I don't get what is wrong with people and why they have such a vendetta against me that they would all of this stuff to me. My intent on making these videos is to raise awareness of cyber harassment and cyber bullying as I don't want others to go through what I went through. My friends think that I'm an idiot for making these videos. They also think that I'm a pedophile too because I also posted another video on my youtube account of some hot 16 year old tiktoker dancing. I wanna go after the people who've done me wrong as I'm sick and tired of being treated like a dog who gets beat. I want to get others to feel and know who it is to get beaten to the pulp. How come people have a problem with me making these videos to raise awareness ???", "category": "Cultures & Groups"},
