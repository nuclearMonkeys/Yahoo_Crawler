	16 : {"q_id":6,"answer":"Hydrogen peroxide H2O2   kills nanoworms inside facemasks. The elite is faking that they took the real vaccine; the real vaccine will cause spiritual and physical damage. When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don’t go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don’t go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.","user":null,"u_id":null,"userpage":null,"likes":"0","dislikes":"0"},

You didn't pay because you couldn't find your landlord which is not related to covid. ","user":"A Hunch","u_id":"cK28Kl0Uaa","userpage":"https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=cK28Kl0Uaa","likes":"2","dislikes":"1"},

If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural).

A police officer could find that the fault is that of both the learner and the instructor and issue both of them tickets. Never will the officer find the instructor alone is at fault because the learner with a learner's permit had to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of driving and traffic laws to get a learner's permit and so the learner, being the driver, is always going to be at fault for any traffic violations.","user":null,"u_id":null,"userpage":null,"likes":"1","dislikes":"4"},

	239 : {"q_id":26,"answer":"  All oil eventually gets contaminated. Additives break down. No, it does Not \"wear out:\". If it did, it couldn't be recycled.   Full synth lasts longest, less friction. Still, check Your owner's manual. Even Synth often requires 7500-10K mile changes. Change Filter, Too, they don't last forever and hold up to a quart of dirty oil.   Oil is lifeblood of yore  engine. Even  $30 for synth  is a good investment. Some new cars require it. Some older cars get shrunken seals and leaks  if you use full  synth; in this case, try a blend. Full synth is  Best for air cooled engines, like  (most) motorcycles.   Suddenly going to F/S after generic mineral oil often comes up very dirty, very soon because of the synth's  greater  detergency. Don't worry, after the next oil change it will stay clean, longer.    My Toyota manual  said 4K miles, did not specify synth v. conventional.  A tiny motor  that runs hard, I still changed whatever oil at 4K.   Again; check Your owner's manual. Better to play low ball.  My new M3  has  service light at 5K with conv. oil; I do it  anyway  with  Mobil One. Same with the Harley; book sez 5K, I change her  at 5,000 miles (or, 100 hrs on running time meter)  even  with Amsoil VTwin synth. I Want my vehicles, especially the Harley,  to Last.     Most car parts jobbers accept waste oil. If not, google your city, they Must   post legal public disposal guidelines.   EDIT: I can save $$ doing it myself.  Filter, oil at Wal Mart. And, I Know it's Done Right. To change oil in the H/D is about $100 At dealer.

	259 : {"q_id":22,"answer":"It's not legal to operate an unregistered car on a public street. That implies you can't park an unregistered car on a public street.  So, the answer to your question is \"No.\" But, if the parking place you have in mind is private property, you might be able to park it there. You would need the property owner's permission. You would also need to have it delivered there, as  in towed or trucked there. If the car is registered by the seller, the seller or agent of the seller could drive it there.  There might be restrictions on how the property may be used. You might not be allowed to keep the car on your front lawn, but you would be allowed to keep it inside a garage, for example. You should be able to buy and own a car if you keep it on private property. So, the question you need to ask is \"Do I have to have a driver's license to register a car?\" That answer depends on where you live. If you live in a state where you do not have to show a driver's license to register it, you could buy the car, register it, and have someone else drive it. You would have to work out something with an auto insurance company. (People who hire chauffeurs do this.)  If your state requires a driver's license to register a car, you can point out you will own the car, but someone else, and not you, will be the driver. Most people in the United States learn to drive before they own a car. They study rules and how to drive. Then they get a learner's permit. They get driving lessons in high school, from a driving school, and/or from their parents. The schools and parents typically own the cars. A learner's permit allows you to drive if you have a licensed driver in the front passenger seat.  Basically, teaching yourself how to drive isn't allowed. They get their first car after they get their driver's license. ","user":"Jogger2425","u_id":"k7hBT7MGaa","userpage":"https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=k7hBT7MGaa","likes":"6","dislikes":"1"},

A heat sink has fins to radiate heat to the air and a fan to blow air across the fins. There is a complex calculation to determine the size and shape of the heat sink. The uP is attached to the sink with special Heat Sink Grease to move the heat to the sink efficiently. the grease is a very thin film between the uP & Sink. A much larger sink will cool more but it will also take up much more room inside the case. A solid block will be much worse. try it with a temp monitor program and watch the heat rise very quickly. You can make an infinite heat sink by using a block of solid silver and making the length 10 times the area if the uP attachment. very large and very expensive.

	404 : {"q_id":73,"answer":"Think and Grow Rich  is one of several old-school classics on this list and its place is well-earned. For twenty years, author Napoleon Hill studied the most successful people of his time, including Henry Ford and Alexander Graham Bell and chronicled those findings together into one neat little package.The main takeaway? A focused, burning desire (or the power of a made-up mind, what Wayne Dyer called intention), gives us the power to achieve or acquire what we want most in life.If you’re looking for insights on how to achieve your dream or a specific goal, this is a classic you can’t do without.The Power of Positive Thinking by Dr. Norman Vincent PealeDr. Peale’s classic is the quintessential self-help book, being one of just a handful of early books from around the 1950s that shaped the entire self-improvement space as a whole. For that reason, there are many themes in the book that you’ll see echoed throughout many of the other books on this list. However, the perspective is slightly different and a refreshing change.The value of positive thinking is such a basic mantra of self-improvement that it’s now almost overlooked. The Power of Positive Thinking is great for anyone looking to get back basics and learn some of the fundamental lessons that are critical to believing self-confidence and an optimistic mindset.The Magic of Thinking Big by David J. SchwartzThe Magic of Thinking Big is a book that I’ll always remember because reading it was probably the first time I was introduced to the true power of the mind. Like Peale’s Positive Thinking, this is another classic, so the examples and speech that Schwartz uses are often entertaining in themselves.Above all else, The Magic of Thinking Big will teach you not to short-change yourself. Think big, don’t settle, and watch as a simple shift in the way you think literally changes your results.The Magic of Thinking Big is great for anyone looking to learn more about how to use the mind to achieve higher levels of success.","user":"Nacy","u_id":"9IX8v74Caa","userpage":"https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=9IX8v74Caa","likes":"1","dislikes":"0"},

	409 : {"q_id":75,"answer":"While I could, I won't. Not because I'm unhelpful, but because the reaction is going to be different for every person hit by an enormous loss. As the writer, you know the character affected better than anyone. You know their background which shaped how they face adversity, you crafted whatever support system they have, you invented their hopes and dreams and how much they involved the dead person, you created the relationship right down to its depth and duration, you birthed the character's inner strengths and hidden weaknesses. Nobody can write it and get it right except you. So take the time to get inside that character's skin. Presumably the loss is enormous, but what, exactly, is their sorrow like? Are they tearing out their hair and clawing at their face and eyes? Then it's your job to explain to the reader why that's their reaction. Numb inside, unable to feel? Refusing to dwell on it? Throwing themself into it like it was a volcano? No appetite, not caring if they live? Actively suicidal? Coming up with a metaphor or simile won't get the job done, even if it's brilliant.","user":"MsBittner","u_id":"dYA8AerXaa","userpage":"https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=dYA8AerXaa","likes":"3","dislikes":"0"},
